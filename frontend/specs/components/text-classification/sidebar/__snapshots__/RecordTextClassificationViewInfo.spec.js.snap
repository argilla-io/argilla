        This dataset contains token attributions. What do highlight colors
        mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        Argilla enables you to register token attributions as part of the
        dataset records. For getting token attributions, you can use methods
        such as Integrated Gradients or SHAP. These methods try to provide a
        mechanism to interpret model predictions.
      </p>
      <p>The attributions work as follows:</p>
      <p>
        [0,1] <strong>Positive attributions</strong> (in blue) reflect those
        tokens that are making the model predict the specific predicted label.
      </p>
      <p>
        [-1, 0] <strong>Negative attributions</strong> (in red) reflect those
        tokens that can influence the model to predict a label other than the
        specific predicted label.
