# Task Distribution

Task Distribution settings are used to define the criteria used by the tool to automatically manage records in the dataset depending on the expected number of submitted responses per record.

## Usage Examples

The default minimum submitted responses per record is 1. If you wish to increase this value, you can define it through the `TaskDistribution` class and pass it to the `Settings` class.
