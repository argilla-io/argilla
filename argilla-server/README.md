Argilla is a **collaboration platform for AI engineers and domain experts** that require **high-quality outputs, full data ownership, and overall efficiency**.

> [!NOTE]
> This README represents the release candidate for the 2.0.0 SDK version. The README for the last stable version of the 1x SDK can be found [1.x](../argilla-v1/README.md)

This repository only contains developer info about the backend server. If you want to get started, we recommend taking a
look at our [main repository](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla) or our [documentation](https://argilla-io.github.io/argilla/latest/).

Are you a contributor or do you want to understand what is going on under the hood, please keep reading the
documentation below.

## Source code folder structure

The following is a high-level overview of relevant folders and files in the argilla-server source code:

```
/argilla_server
  /api # Including all the API endpoints and related code
    /errors # Custom exceptions and error handlers
      /v1
    /handlers # Request FastAPI handlers
      /v1
    /policies # Authorization policies for resources
      /v1
    /schemas # Pydantic schemas for request and response bodies
      /v1
  /contexts # Domain contexts for the application including business logic
    accounts.py
    datasets.py
    search.py
    ...
  /models # SQLAlchemy ORM models for the database
    database.py
```

Folders inside `/api` are organized by API version, having right now only v1 implemented. This is in contrast to `/contexts` and `/models` folders that are not versioned. This is because the business logic and canonical database models are not exposed directly to the API, and therefore are not subject to versioning.

## Development environment

By default all commands executed with `pdm run` will get environment variables from `.env.dev` except command `pdm test`
that will overwrite some of them using values coming from `.env.test` file.

These environment variables can be override if necessary so feel free to defined your own ones locally.

### Run cli

```sh
pdm cli
```

### Run database migrations

By default a SQLite located at `~/.argilla/argilla.db` will be used. You can create the database and run migrations with
the following custom PDM command:

```sh
pdm migrate
```

### Run tests

A SQLite database located at `~/.argilla/argilla-test.db` will be automatically created to run tests. You can run the
entire test suite using the following custom PDM command:

```sh
pdm test
```

## Run development server

Note: If you need to run the frontend server you can follow the instructions at
the [argilla-frontend](/argilla-frontend/README.md) project

### Run uvicorn development server

```sh
pdm server
```
