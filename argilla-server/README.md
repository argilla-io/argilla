Argilla is a **collaboration platform for AI engineers and domain experts** that require **high-quality outputs, full data ownership, and overall efficiency**.

This repository only contains developer info about the backend server. If you want to get started, we recommend taking a
look at our [main repository](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla) or our [documentation](https://argilla-io.github.io/argilla/latest/).

Are you a contributor or do you want to understand what is going on under the hood, please keep reading the
documentation below.

## Source code folder structure

The following is a high-level overview of relevant folders and files in the argilla-server source code:

```
/argilla_server
  /api # Including all the API endpoints and related code
    /errors # Custom exceptions and error handlers
      /v1
    /handlers # Request FastAPI handlers
      /v1
    /policies # Authorization policies for resources
      /v1
    /schemas # Pydantic schemas for request and response bodies
      /v1
  /contexts # Domain contexts for the application including business logic
    accounts.py
    datasets.py
    search.py
    ...
  /models # SQLAlchemy ORM models for the database
    database.py
```

Folders inside `/api` are organized by API version, having right now only v1 implemented. This is in contrast to `/contexts` and `/models` folders that are not versioned. This is because the business logic and canonical database models are not exposed directly to the API, and therefore are not subject to versioning.

## Development environment

By default all commands executed with `pdm run` will get environment variables from `.env.dev` except the command `pdm test` which will overwrite some of them using values coming from `.env.test` file.

These environment variables can be overridden if necessary so feel free to define your own ones locally.

### Run development server

This single command prepares the development server to run locally. It does so by chaining commands to migrate the databse, create default users and launch the server on the right port.

```sh
pdm server-dev
```

### Run tests

A SQLite database located at `~/.argilla/argilla-test.db` will be automatically created to run tests. You can run the
entire test suite using the following custom PDM command:

```sh
pdm test
```

### Run frontend

If you need to run the frontend server you can follow the instructions at the [argilla-frontend](/argilla-frontend/README.md) project.

## Development commands

### Run cli

```sh
pdm cli
```

### Run database migrations

By default, the SQLite database is located at `~/.argilla/argilla.db` will be used. You can create the database and run migrations with
the following custom PDM command:

```sh
pdm migrate
```

### Run uvicorn FastAPI server

```sh
pdm server
```

## CLI commands

This section list and describe the commands offered by the `argilla_server` Python package. If you need more information about the available
commands in the CLI you can use the `--help` option:

```sh
python -m argilla_server --help
```

If you need more information about a specific command you can use the `--help` option too:

```sh
python -m argilla_server database --help
```

### Start the server

The `argilla_server start` command will start the Argilla server blocking the current terminal. You can use the following command to start the server:

```sh
python -m argilla_server start
```

The following options can be provided:

- `--host`: The host where the Argilla server will be bound. Default value is `0.0.0.0`.
- `--port`: The port where the Argilla server will be bound. Default value is `6900`.
- `--access-log/--no-access-log`: Enable/disable the server access log. Default value is `True`.

### Database

The `argilla_server database` group of commands offers functionality for managing the Argilla server database:

- `python -m argilla_server database migrate`: applies the database migrations.
- `python -m argilla_server database revisions`: list the different revisions to which the database can be migrated.

#### Users management

The `argilla_server database users` group of commands offers functionality for managing the users of the Argilla server.

- `python -m argilla_server database users create`: creates a new user in the Argilla server database.
- `python -m argilla_server database users create_default`: creates the default users in the Argilla server database.
- `python -m argilla_server database users migrate`: migrates the users from the old `YAML` file to the Argilla server database.
- `python -m argilla_server database users update`: updates a user in the Argilla server database.

### Search engine

The `argilla_server search-engine` group of commands offers functionality to work with the search engine used by Argilla.

- `python -m argilla_server search-engine reindex`: reindex all Argilla entities into search engine.
