# Contribute to Argilla

Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution. Code
contributions are not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping
others, and improving the documentation are also immensely valuable.

It also helps us if you spread the word! Reference the library in blog posts
about the awesome projects it made possible, shout out on Twitter every time it has
helped you, or simply ⭐️ the repository to say thank you.

However you choose to contribute, please be mindful and respect our
[code of conduct](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
