# tmp

This is a [SetFit model](https://github.com/huggingface/setfit) that can be used for text classification. The model has been trained using an efficient few-shot learning technique that involves:

1. Fine-tuning a [Sentence Transformer](https://www.sbert.net) with contrastive learning.
2. Training a classification head with features from the fine-tuned Sentence Transformer.

## Usage

To use this model for inference, first install the SetFit library:

```bash
python -m pip install setfit
```

You can then run inference as follows:

```python
from setfit import SetFitModel

# Download from Hub and run inference
model = SetFitModel.from_pretrained("tmp")
# Run inference
preds = model(["i loved the spiderman movie!", "pineapple on pizza is the worst ðŸ¤®"])
```
