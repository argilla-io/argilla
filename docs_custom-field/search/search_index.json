Remember that the answers are automatically logged into your Argilla instance.</p> <pre><code>questions = [\n    \"How can I list the available datasets?\",\n    \"Which are the user credentials?\",\n    \"Can I use markdown in Argilla?\",\n    \"Could you explain how to annotate datasets in Argilla?\",\n]\n\nanswers = []\n\nfor question in questions:\n    answers.append(query_engine.query(question))\n\nfor question, answer in zip(questions, answers):\n    print(f\"Question: {question}\")\n    print(f\"Answer: {answer}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------\")\n</code></pre> <pre>\n<code>Question: How can I list the available datasets?\nAnswer: You can list all the datasets available in a workspace by utilizing the `datasets` attribute of the `Workspace` class. Additionally, you can determine the number of datasets in a workspace by using `len(workspace.datasets)`. To list the datasets, you can iterate over them and print out each dataset. Remember that dataset settings are not preloaded when listing datasets, and if you need to work with settings, you must load them explicitly for each dataset.\n----------------------------\nQuestion: Which are the user credentials?\nAnswer: The user credentials in Argilla consist of a username, password, and API key.\n----------------------------\nQuestion: Can I use markdown in Argilla?\nAnswer: Yes, you can use Markdown in Argilla.\n----------------------------\nQuestion: Could you explain how to annotate datasets in Argilla?\nAnswer: To annotate datasets in Argilla, users can manage their data annotation projects by setting up `Users`, `Workspaces`, `Datasets`, and `Records`. By deploying Argilla on the Hugging Face Hub or with `Docker`, installing the Python SDK with `pip`, and creating the first project, users can get started in just 5 minutes. The tool allows for interacting with data in a more engaging way through features like quick labeling with filters, AI feedback suggestions, and semantic search, enabling users to focus on training models and monitoring their performance effectively.\n----------------------------\n</code>\n</pre> <pre>\n<code>\n</code>\n</pre>"},{"location":"community/integrations/llamaindex_rag_github/#create-a-rag-system-expert-in-a-github-repository-and-log-your-predictions-in-argilla","title":"\ud83d\udd75\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Create a RAG system expert in a GitHub repository and log your predictions in Argilla","text":"<p>In this tutorial, we'll show you how to create a RAG system that can answer questions about a specific GitHub repository.

It is designed to help you achieve and keep high-quality data standards, store your training data, store the results of your models, evaluate their performance, and improve the data through human and AI feedback.</p> Does Argilla cost money? <p>No. Argilla is an open-source project and is free to use. You can deploy Argilla on your own infrastructure or use our cloud offering.</p> What data types does Argilla support? <p>Text data, mostly. Argilla natively supports textual data, however, we do support rich text, which means you can represent different types of data in Argilla as long as you can convert it to text. For example, you can store images, audio, video, and any other type of data as long as you can convert it to their base64 representation or render them as HTML in for example an IFrame.</p> Does Argilla train models? <p>No. Argilla is a collaboration tool to achieve and keep high-quality data standards. You can use Argilla to store your training data, store the results of your models, evaluate their performance and improve the data. For training models, you can use any machine learning framework or library that you prefer even though we recommend starting with Hugging Face Transformers.</p> Does Argilla provide annotation workforces? <p>Yes, kind of. We don't provide annotation workforce in-house but we do have partnerships with workforce providers that ensure ethical practices and secure work environments. Feel free to schedule a meeting here or contact us via email.</p> How does Argilla differ from competitors like Lilac, Snorkel, Prodigy and Scale? <p>Argilla distinguishes itself for its focus on specific use cases and human-in-the-loop approaches. While it does offer programmatic features, Argilla\u2019s core value lies in actively involving human experts in the tool-building process, setting it apart from other competitors.</p> <p>Furthermore, Argilla places particular emphasis on smooth integration with other tools in the community, particularly within the realms of MLOps and NLP. So, its compatibility with popular frameworks like spaCy and Hugging Face makes it exceptionally user-friendly and accessible.</p> <p>Finally, platforms like Snorkel, Prodigy or Scale, while more comprehensive, often require a significant commitment. Argilla, on the other hand, works more as a tool within the MLOps ecosystem, allowing users to begin with specific use cases and then scale up as needed. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for users and customers who prefer to start small and expand their applications over time, as opposed to committing to an all-encompassing tool from the outset.</p> What is the difference between Argilla 2.0 and the legacy datasets in 1.0? <p>Argilla 1.0 relied on 3 main task datasets: <code>DatasetForTextClassification</code>, <code>DatasetForTokenClassification</code>, and <code>DatasetForText2Text</code>. These tasks were designed to be simple, easy to use and high in functionality but they were limited in adaptability. With the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the increasing complexity of NLP tasks, we realized that we needed to expand the capabilities of Argilla to support more advanced feedback mechanisms which led to the introduction of the <code>FeedbackDataset</code>. Compared to its predecessor it was high in adaptability but still limited in functionality. After having ported all of the functionality of the legacy tasks to the new <code>FeedbackDataset</code>, we decided to deprecate the legacy tasks in favor of a brand new SDK with the <code>FeedbackDataset</code> at its core.</p>"},{"location":"getting_started/how-to-configure-argilla-on-huggingface/","title":"Hugging Face Spaces Settings","text":"<p>This section details how to configure and deploy Argilla on Hugging Face Spaces.

Otherwise, you can quickly deploy Argilla following this guide.</p> <p>To complete this tutorial, you need to install the Argilla SDK and a few third-party libraries via <code>pip</code>.</p> <pre><code>!pip install argilla\n</code></pre> <pre><code>!pip install \"transformers[torch]~=4.0\" \"accelerate~=0.34\"\n</code></pre> <p>Let's make the required imports:</p> <pre><code>import base64\nimport io\nimport re\n\nfrom IPython.display import display\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, Dataset, load_metric\nfrom transformers import (\n    AutoImageProcessor,\n    AutoModelForImageClassification,\n    pipeline,\n    Trainer,\n    TrainingArguments\n)\n\nimport argilla as rg\n</code></pre> <p>You also need to connect to the Argilla server using the <code>api_url</code> and <code>api_key</code>.</p> <pre><code># Replace api_url with your url if using Docker\n# Replace api_key with your API key under \"My Settings\" in the UI\n# Uncomment the last line and set your HF_TOKEN if your space is private\nclient = rg.Argilla(\n    api_url=\"https://[your-owner-name]-[your_space_name].hf.space\",\n    api_key=\"[your-api-key]\",\n    # headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {HF_TOKEN}\"}\n)\n</code></pre> <p>Now, we will need to configure the dataset. In the settings, we can specify the guidelines, fields, and questions. If needed, you can also add metadata and vectors. However, for our use case, we just need a field for the <code>image</code> column and a label question for the <code>label</code> column.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Check this how-to guide to know more about configuring and creating a dataset.</p> <pre><code>labels = [str(x) for x in range(10)]\n\nsettings = rg.Settings(\n    guidelines=\"The goal of this task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.\",\n    fields=[\n        rg.ImageField(\n            name=\"image\",\n            title=\"An image of a handwritten digit.\",\n        ),\n    ],\n    questions=[\n        rg.LabelQuestion(\n            name=\"image_label\",\n            title=\"What digit do you see on the image?\",\n            labels=labels,\n        )\n    ]\n)\n</code></pre> <p>Let's create the dataset with the name and the defined settings:</p> <pre><code>dataset = rg.Dataset(\n    name=\"image_classification_dataset\",\n    settings=settings,\n)\ndataset.create()\n</code></pre> <p>Even if we have created the dataset, it still lacks the information to be annotated (you can check it in the UI). We will use the <code>ylecun/mnist</code> dataset from the Hugging Face Hub. Specifically, we will use <code>100</code> examples. Because we are dealing with a potentially large image dataset, we will set <code>streaming=True</code> to avoid loading the entire dataset into memory and iterate over the data to lazily load it.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>When working with Hugging Face datasets, you can set <code>Image(decode=False)</code> so that we can get public image URLs, but this depends on the dataset.</p> <pre><code>n_rows = 100\n\nhf_dataset = load_dataset(\"ylecun/mnist\", streaming=True)\ndataset_rows = [row for _,row in zip(range(n_rows), hf_dataset[\"train\"])]\nhf_dataset = Dataset.from_list(dataset_rows)\n\nhf_dataset\n</code></pre> <pre>\n<code>Dataset({\n    features: ['image', 'label'],\n    num_rows: 100\n})</code>\n</pre> <p>Let's have a look at the first image in the dataset.</p> <pre><code>hf_dataset[0]\n</code></pre> <pre>\n<code>{'image': &lt;PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=L size=28x28&gt;,\n 'label': 5}</code>\n</pre> <p>We will easily add them to the dataset using <code>log</code>, without needing a mapping since the names already match the Argilla resources. Additionally, since the images are already in PIL format and defined as <code>Image</code> in the Hugging Face dataset\u2019s features, we can log them directly. We will also include an <code>id</code> column in each record, allowing us to easily trace back to the external data source.</p> <pre><code>hf_dataset = hf_dataset.add_column(\"id\", range(len(hf_dataset)))\ndataset.records.log(records=hf_dataset)\n</code></pre> <p>The next step is to add suggestions to the dataset. This will make things easier and faster for the annotation team. Suggestions will appear as preselected options, so annotators will only need to correct them. In our case, we will generate them using a zero-shot CLIP model. However, you can use a framework or technique of your choice.</p> <p>We will start by loading the model using a <code>transformers</code> pipeline.</p> <pre><code>checkpoint = \"openai/clip-vit-large-patch14\"\ndetector = pipeline(model=checkpoint, task=\"zero-shot-image-classification\")\n</code></pre> <p>Now, let's try to make a model prediction and see if it makes sense.</p> <pre><code>predictions = detector(hf_dataset[1][\"image\"], candidate_labels=labels)\npredictions, display(hf_dataset[1][\"image\"])\n</code></pre> <pre>\n<code>([{'score': 0.5236628651618958, 'label': '0'},\n  {'score': 0.11496700346469879, 'label': '7'},\n  {'score': 0.08030630648136139, 'label': '8'},\n  {'score': 0.07141078263521194, 'label': '9'},\n  {'score': 0.05868939310312271, 'label': '6'},\n  {'score': 0.05507850646972656, 'label': '5'},\n  {'score': 0.0341767854988575, 'label': '1'},\n  {'score': 0.027202051132917404, 'label': '4'},\n  {'score': 0.018533246591687202, 'label': '3'},\n  {'score': 0.015973029658198357, 'label': '2'}],\n None)</code>\n</pre> <p>It's time to make the predictions on the dataset! We will set a function that uses the zero-shot model. The model will infer the label based on the image. When working with large datasets, you can create a <code>batch_predict</code> method to speed up the process.</p> <pre><code>def predict(input, labels):\n    prediction = detector(input, candidate_labels=labels)\n    prediction = prediction[0]\n    return {\"image_label\": prediction[\"label\"], \"score\": prediction[\"score\"]}\n</code></pre> <p>To update the records, we will need to retrieve them from the server and update them with the new suggestions. The <code>id</code> will always need to be provided as it is the records' identifier to update a record and avoid creating a new one.</p> <pre><code>data = dataset.records.to_list(flatten=True)\nupdated_data = [\n    {\n        \"id\": sample[\"id\"],\n        **predict(sample[\"image\"], labels),\n    }\n    for sample in data\n]\ndataset.records.log(records=updated_data, mapping={\"score\": \"image_label.suggestion.score\"})\n</code></pre> <p>Voil\u00e0! We have added the suggestions to the dataset, and they will appear in the UI marked with a \u2728. </p> <p>Now, we can start the annotation process. Just open the dataset in the Argilla UI and start annotating the records. If the suggestions are correct, you can just click on <code>Submit</code>. Otherwise, you can select the correct label.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Check this how-to guide to know more about annotating in the UI.</p> <p>After the annotation, we will have a robust dataset to train the main model. In our case, we will fine-tune using transformers. However, you can select the one that best fits your requirements.</p> <p>So, let's start by retrieving the annotated records and exporting them as a <code>Dataset</code>, so images will be in PIL format.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Check this how-to guide to know more about filtering and querying in Argilla. Also, you can check the Hugging Face docs on fine-tuning an image classification model.</p> <pre><code>dataset = client.datasets(\"image_classification_dataset\")\n</code></pre> <pre><code>status_filter = rg.Query(filter=rg.Filter((\"response.status\", \"==\", \"submitted\")))\n\nsubmitted = dataset.records(status_filter).to_datasets()\n</code></pre> <p>We now need to ensure our images are forwarded with the correct dimensions. Because the original MNIST dataset is greyscale and the VIT model expects RGB, we need to add a channel dimension to the images. We will do this by stacking the images along the channel axis.</p> <pre><code>def greyscale_to_rgb(img) -&amp;gt; Image:\n    return Image.merge('RGB', (img, img, img))\n\nsubmitted_image_rgb = [\n    {\n        \"id\": sample[\"id\"],\n        \"image\": greyscale_to_rgb(sample[\"image\"]),\n        \"label\": sample[\"image_label.responses\"][0],\n    }\n    for sample in submitted\n]\nsubmitted_image_rgb[0]\n</code></pre> <pre>\n<code>{'id': '0', 'image': &lt;PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=28x28&gt;, 'label': '0'}</code>\n</pre> <p>Next, we will load the <code>ImageProcessor</code> to fine-tune the model. This processor will handle the image resizing and normalization in order to be compatible with the model we intend to use.</p> <pre><code>checkpoint = \"google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k\"\nprocessor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\n\nsubmitted_image_rgb_processed = [\n    {\n        \"pixel_values\": processor(sample[\"image\"], return_tensors='pt')[\"pixel_values\"],\n        \"label\": sample[\"label\"],\n    }\n    for sample in submitted_image_rgb\n]\nsubmitted_image_rgb_processed[0]\n</code></pre> <p>We can now convert the images to a Hugging Face Dataset that is ready for fine-tuning.</p> <pre><code>prepared_ds = Dataset.from_list(submitted_image_rgb_processed)\nprepared_ds = prepared_ds.train_test_split(test_size=0.2)\nprepared_ds\n</code></pre> <pre>\n<code>DatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['pixel_values', 'label'],\n        num_rows: 80\n    })\n    test: Dataset({\n        features: ['pixel_values', 'label'],\n        num_rows: 20\n    })\n})</code>\n</pre> <p>We then need to define our data collator, which will ensure the data is unpacked and stacked correctly for the model.</p> <pre><code>def collate_fn(batch):\n    return {\n        'pixel_values': torch.stack([torch.tensor(x['pixel_values'][0]) for x in batch]),\n        'labels': torch.tensor([int(x['label']) for x in batch])\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we can define our training metrics. We will use the accuracy metric to evaluate the model's performance.</p> <pre><code>metric = load_metric(\"accuracy\", trust_remote_code=True)\ndef compute_metrics(p):\n    return metric.compute(predictions=np.argmax(p.predictions, axis=1), references=p.label_ids)\n</code></pre> <p>We then load our model and configure the labels that we will use for training.</p> <pre><code>model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(\n    checkpoint,\n    num_labels=len(labels),\n    id2label={int(i): int(c) for i, c in enumerate(labels)},\n    label2id={int(c): int(i) for i, c in enumerate(labels)}\n)\nmodel.config\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, we define the training arguments and start the training process.</p> <pre><code>training_args = TrainingArguments(\n  output_dir=\"./image-classifier\",\n  per_device_train_batch_size=16,\n  eval_strategy=\"steps\",\n  num_train_epochs=1,\n  fp16=False, # True if you have a GPU with mixed precision support\n  save_steps=100,\n  eval_steps=100,\n  logging_steps=10,\n  learning_rate=2e-4,\n  save_total_limit=2,\n  remove_unused_columns=True,\n  push_to_hub=False,\n  load_best_model_at_end=True,\n)\n\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=training_args,\n    data_collator=collate_fn,\n    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,\n    train_dataset=prepared_ds[\"train\"],\n    eval_dataset=prepared_ds[\"test\"],\n    tokenizer=processor,\n)\n\ntrain_results = trainer.train()\ntrainer.save_model()\ntrainer.log_metrics(\"train\", train_results.metrics)\ntrainer.save_metrics(\"train\", train_results.metrics)\ntrainer.save_state()\n</code></pre> <pre>\n<code>{'train_runtime': 12.5374, 'train_samples_per_second': 6.381, 'train_steps_per_second': 0.399, 'train_loss': 2.0533515930175783, 'epoch': 1.0}\n***** train metrics *****\n  epoch                    =        1.0\n  total_flos               =  5774017GF\n  train_loss               =     2.0534\n  train_runtime            = 0:00:12.53\n  train_samples_per_second =      6.381\n  train_steps_per_second   =      0.399\n</code>\n</pre> <p>As the training data was of better quality, we can expect a better model.

Thus, we will define a function to extract the annotated NER tags according to this schema.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>For further information, you can check the SpanMarker documentation.</p> <pre><code>def get_iob_tag_for_token(token_start, token_end, ner_spans):\n    for span in ner_spans:\n        if token_start &amp;gt;= span[\"start\"] and token_end &amp;lt;= span[\"end\"]:\n            if token_start == span[\"start\"]:\n                return f\"B-{span['label']}\"\n            else:\n                return f\"I-{span['label']}\"\n    return \"O\"\n\n\ndef extract_ner_tags(text, responses):\n    tokens = re.split(r\"(\\s+)\", text)\n    ner_tags = []\n\n    current_position = 0\n    for token in tokens:\n        if token.strip():\n            token_start = current_position\n            token_end = current_position + len(token)\n            tag = get_iob_tag_for_token(token_start, token_end, responses)\n            ner_tags.append(tag)\n        current_position += len(token)\n\n    return ner_tags\n</code></pre> <p>Let's now extract them and save two lists with the tokens and NER tags, which will help us build our dataset to train the SpanMarker model.</p> <pre><code>tokens = []\nner_tags = []\nfor r in submitted:\n    tags = extract_ner_tags(r[\"text\"], r[\"span_label.responses\"][0])\n    tks = r[\"text\"].split()\n    tokens.append(tks)\n    ner_tags.append(tags)\n</code></pre> <p>In addition, we will have to indicate the labels and they should be formatted as integers. So, we will retrieve them and map them.</p> <pre><code>labels = list(set([item for sublist in ner_tags for item in sublist]))\n\nid2label = {i: label for i, label in enumerate(labels)}\nlabel2id = {label: id_ for id_, label in id2label.items()}\n\nmapped_ner_tags = [[label2id[label] for label in ner_tag] for ner_tag in ner_tags]\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, we will create a dataset with the train and validation sets.</p> <pre><code>records = [\n    {\n        \"tokens\": token,\n        \"ner_tags\": ner_tag,\n    }\n    for token, ner_tag in zip(tokens, mapped_ner_tags)\n]\nspan_dataset = DatasetDict(\n    {\n        \"train\": Dataset.from_list(records[:1500]),\n        \"validation\": Dataset.from_list(records[1501:2000]),\n    }\n)\n</code></pre> <p>Now, let's prepare to train our model. For this, it is recommended to use GPU. You can check if it is available as shown below.</p> <pre><code>if torch.cuda.is_available():\n    device = torch.device(\"cuda\")\n    print(f\"Using {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}\")\nelif torch.backends.mps.is_available():\n    device = torch.device(\"mps\")\n    print(\"Using MPS device\")\nelse:\n    device = torch.device(\"cpu\")\n    print(\"No GPU available, using CPU instead.\")\n</code></pre> <p>We will define our model and arguments. In this case, we will use the <code>bert-base-cased</code>, available in the Hugging Face Hub, but others can be applied.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The training arguments are inherited from the Transformers library. You can check more information here.</p> <pre><code>encoder_id = \"bert-base-cased\"\nmodel = SpanMarkerModel.from_pretrained(\n    encoder_id,\n    labels=labels,\n    model_max_length=256,\n    entity_max_length=8,\n)\n\nargs = TrainingArguments(\n    output_dir=\"models/span-marker\",\n    learning_rate=5e-5,\n    per_device_train_batch_size=8,\n    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,\n    num_train_epochs=1,\n    weight_decay=0.01,\n    warmup_ratio=0.1,\n    fp16=False,  # Set to True if available\n    logging_first_step=True,\n    logging_steps=50,\n    evaluation_strategy=\"steps\",\n    save_strategy=\"steps\",\n    eval_steps=500,\n    save_total_limit=2,\n    dataloader_num_workers=2,\n)\n\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=args,\n    train_dataset=span_dataset[\"train\"],\n    eval_dataset=span_dataset[\"validation\"],\n)\n</code></pre> <p>Let's train it! This time, we use a high-quality human-annotated training set, so the results are expected to have improved.</p> <pre><code>trainer.train()\n</code></pre> <pre><code>trainer.evaluate()\n</code></pre> <p>You can save it locally or push it to the Hub. And then load it from there.</p> <pre><code># Save and load locally\n# model.save_pretrained(\"token_classification_model\")\n# model = SpanMarkerModel.from_pretrained(\"token_classification_model\")\n\n# Push and load in HF\n# model.push_to_hub(\"[username]/token_classification_model\")\n# model = SpanMarkerModel.from_pretrained(\"[username]/token_classification_model\")\n</code></pre> <p>It's time to make the predictions! We will set a function that uses the <code>predict</code> method to get the suggested label. The model will infer the label based on the text. The function will return the spans in the corresponding structure for the Argilla dataset.</p> <pre><code>def predict_spanmarker(model, text):\n    entities = model.predict(text)\n    return [\n        {\n            \"start\": ent[\"char_start_index\"],\n            \"end\": ent[\"char_end_index\"],\n            \"label\": ent[\"label\"],\n        }\n        for ent in entities\n    ]\n</code></pre> <p>As the training data was of better quality, we can expect a better model. So we can update the remaining non-annotated records with the new model's suggestions.</p> <pre><code>data = dataset.records.to_list(flatten=True)\nupdated_data = [\n    {\n        \"span_label\": predict_spanmarker(model=model, text=sample[\"text\"]),\n        \"id\": sample[\"id\"],\n    }\n    for sample in data\n]\ndataset.records.log(records=updated_data)\n</code></pre> <p>In this tutorial, we present an end-to-end example of a token classification task. This serves as the base, but it can be performed iteratively and seamlessly integrated into your workflow to ensure high-quality curation of your data and improved results.</p> <p>We started by configuring the dataset, adding records, and adding suggestions based on the GLiNer predictions. After the annotation process, we trained a SpanMarker model with the annotated data and updated the remaining records with the new suggestions.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/token_classification/#token-classification","title":"Token classification","text":""},{"location":"tutorials/token_classification/#getting-started","title":"Getting started","text":""},{"location":"tutorials/token_classification/#deploy-the-argilla-server","title":"Deploy the Argilla server","text":""},{"location":"tutorials/token_classification/#set-up-the-environment","title":"Set up the environment","text":""},{"location":"tutorials/token_classification/#vibe-check-the-dataset","title":"Vibe check the dataset","text":"<p>We will have a look at the dataset to understand its structure and the kind of data it contains.
