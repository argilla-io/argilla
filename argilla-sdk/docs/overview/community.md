## Community

We are an open-source community-driven project and we love to hear from you. Here are some ways to get involved:

- [Community Meetup](https://lu.ma/embed-checkout/evt-IQtRiSuXZCIW6FB): listen in or present during one of our bi-weekly events.

- [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rubrixworkspace/shared_invite/zt-whigkyjn-a3IUJLD7gDbTZ0rKlvcJ5g): get direct support from the community.

- [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/argilla-io/projects/10/views/1): plans change but we love to discuss those with our community so feel encouraged to participate.
