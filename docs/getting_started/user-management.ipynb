    "\n",
    "This guide explains how to setup the users and team workspaces for your Rubrix instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first describe Rubrix's user management model:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## User management model\n",
    "\n",
    "### `User`\n",
    "\n",
    "A Rubrix user is defined by the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `username`: The username to use for login into the Webapp.\n",
    "- `email`(optional): The user's email.\n",
    "- `fullname` (optional): The user's full name\n",
    "- `disabled`(optional): Whether this use is enabled (and can interact with Rubrix), this might be useful for disabling user access temporarily.\n",
    "- `workspaces`(optional): The team workspaces where the user has read and write access (both from the Webapp and the Python client). If this field is not defined the user will be a super-user and have access to all datasets in the instance. If this field is set to an empty list `[]` the user will only have access to her user workspace. Read more about workspaces and users below.\n",
    "- `api_key`: The API key to interact with Rubrix API, mainly through the Python client but also via HTTP for advanced users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Workspace`\n",
    "\n",
    "A workspace is a Rubrix \"space\" where users can collaborate, both using the Webapp and the Python client. There are two types of workspace:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Team workspace`: Where one or several users have read/write access.\n",
    "- `User workspace`: Every user gets its own user workspace. This workspace is the default workspace when users log and load data with the Python client. The name of this workspace corresponds to the username.\n",
    "\n",
    "A user is given access to a workspace by including the name of the workspace in the list of workspaces defined by the `workspaces` field. **Users with no defined workspaces field are super-users** and have access and right to all datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python client methods and workspaces\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python client gives developers the ability to log, load, and copy datasets from and to different workspace. Check out the [Python Reference](../reference/python/python_client.rst) for the parameter and methods related to workspaces.\n",
