===========================

Supported tasks
---------------

Text classification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

According to the amazing `NLP Progress resource by Seb Ruder <http://nlpprogress.com/english/text_classification.html>`_:

..

   Text classification is the task of assigning a sentence or document an appropriate category. The categories depend on the chosen dataset and can range from topics.




Rubrix is flexible with input and output shapes, which means you can model many related tasks like for example:

* `Sentiment analysis <http://nlpprogress.com/english/sentiment_analysis.html>`_ 
* `Natural Language Inference <http://nlpprogress.com/english/natural_language_inference.html>`_
* `Relationship Extraction <http://nlpprogress.com/english/relationship_extraction.html>`_
* `Stance detection <http://nlpprogress.com/english/stance_detection.html>`_
* **Multi-label text classification**
* **Node classification in knowledge graphs**.

Token classification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most well-known task in this category is probably `Named Entity Recognition <http://nlpprogress.com/english/named_entity_recognition.html>`_:

..

   Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of tagging entities in text with their corresponding type. Approaches typically use BIO notation, which differentiates the beginning (B) and the inside (I) of entities. O is used for non-entity tokens.




Rubrix is flexible with input and output shapes, which means you can model related tasks like for example:


* Named entity recognition
* Part of speech tagging
