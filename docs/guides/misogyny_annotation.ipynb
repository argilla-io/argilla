    "# Annotate new data to improve Misogyny Detection models using Rubrix and biome.text\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey there! In this article, I will show you how we used Rubrix to annotate new data and use this new data to improve existing Deep Learning models. Our use case was **Automatic Misogyny Detection** (AMI): NLP models able to detect the underlying misogyny on a given text. Ground-breaking work is being made every year on this subject, with shared tasks and new ideas that push the performance of these models closer and closer to what a moderation team of humans could do. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside Rubrix, we used our amazing NLP library [biome.text](https://github.com/recognai/biome-text) to train models with a simple workflow. Rubrix is compatible with almost any library or service, so we were able to work back and forth with both of them. "

    "## Our objective\n",
    "\n",
    "I was preparing my Bachelor's thesis on the subject of Automatic Misogyny Detection, with data from several shared tasks and competitions on the subject. In this setting, we wanted to use the potential of Rubrix in our favour, going beyond the classic linear workflows that are so common in Deep Learning: gathering some data, preprocessing it, training a model and start making inference. Rubrix breaks that scheme; it allowed us to use a human-in-the-loop approach with retraining and fine-tuning and to add new data in follow-up trainings. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to talk you more about it in this article. It is not intended to be a tutorial, even though there will be snippets of code to reproduce our process and get to similar result (we will simplify some aspects of it to keep it light-weighted), but more of a story. We will focus on the process and on what we learnt along the way. "

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bachelor's thesis was focused on the Spanish language, and datasets of misogyny in Spanish text are nothing but scarce. This was the first hardship: finding datasets to start training some models. Luckily, there is a very important community of shared tasks focused on the matter, covering a lot of non-English languages. We started working with data from [IberEval 2018](https://sites.google.com/view/ibereval-2…), a shared-task that offered a compilation of tweets, analyzed by experts and classified into 5 different misogyny categories and 2 targets. We started training our first model with around three thousand instances of annotated data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, the [EXIST](http://nlp.uned.es/exist2021/) task at [IberLEF 2021](https://sites.google.com/view/iberlef2021) came to our sight. We saw there a perfect opportunity for our work on misogyny detection, for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   To test our approach on misogyny detection on a different subdomain, with different data.\n",
    "*   To expand our three-thousand-or-so instances dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We covered our participation in the EXIST task in an [entry of our blogpost](https://medium.com/recognai/against-sexism-like-a-machine-2ae9227881ef). After we submitted our runs, we shifted our efforts towards integrating these new data into our corpus. The categorization was different: IberEval 2018 used a categorization system of 5 categories and 2 targets, but IberLEF 2021 didn't have a target field, and its categories were different. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the classic approach of Deep Learning, our journey would have ended there: with two different, incompatible datasets. But, thanks to Rubrix, it was only the beginning. "

    "## Merging data from different sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The thesis started around the data corpus of IberEval 2018. Misogyny classification, which was established by the organization, is made following these categories:\n",
    "*   **Misogynous**: binary field, defines if the tweet is sexist or not.\n",
    "*   **Misogyny category:** denotes the type of misogynistic behaviour if there is misogyny in the text. 5 possible categories; *Stereotype & Objectification*, *Dominance*, *Derailing*, *Sexual Harassment & Threats of Violence* and *Discredit*.\n",
    "*   **Misogyny target**: Active, if the misogyny behaviour is targetted towards a specific woman or group of women or Passive if the behaviour is targetted to many potential receivers, even women as a gender. \n",
    "\n",
    "After our participation in EXIST at IberLEF 2021, we decied to include more training data in the thesis. Originally, we wanted to scrap Twitter and manually retrieve misogynistic tweets. However, using data originally annotated from experts, which was also used by the NLP community, seemed the right thing to do. The only problem was the label system, which was different:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Misogynous**: the same binary field as in IberEval 2018.\n",
    "*   **Misogyny category**: 5 different categories; *Idelogical & Inequality*, *Stereotyping & Dominance*, *Objectification*, *Sexual Violence*, *Misogyny and Non-sexual Violence*. This labelling system has no misogyny target.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, Rubrix became an essential tool for our work. It allowed us to explore both data corpuses, and make an annotation phase to adapt the data from EXIST into the standard of IberEval 2018.\n"
