    "# Annotate new data to improve Misogyny Detection models using Rubrix and biome.text\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey there! In this guide, we will show you how we used Rubrix to annotate new data and use this new data to improve existing Deep Learning models. Our use case was Automatic Misogyny Detection (AMI): NLP models able to detect the underlying misogyny on a given text. Ground-breaking work is being made every year on this subject, with shared tasks and new models that push the performance of these models closer and closer to be implemented in apps, social networks, and other digital environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside Rubrix, we used our amazing NLP libary [biome.text](https://github.com/recognai/biome-text) to train models with a simple workflow. Rubrix is compatible with almost any library or service, so we were able to work back and forth with both of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "If it's your first time around, we recomend to start by reading our documentation [front page](https://docs.rubrix.ml/en/stable/). After that, you can continue by reading the Getting Started section. "

    "## Our objective\n",
    "\n",
    "One of our team members, Ignacio, was preparing his Bachelor's thesis on the subject of Automatic Misogyny Detection. In this setting, we wanted to use the potential of Rubrix on our favor, going beyond the classic linear workflows that are so common in Deep Learning: gathering some data, preprocessing it, training a model and start making inference. Rubrix breaks that scheme, and allowed us to use a man-in-the-middle approach with retraining and fine-tuning and to add new data in follow-up trainings. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to talk you more about it in this guide. It is not intended to be a tutorial, even though there will be snippets of code to reproduce our process and get to similar result (we will simplify some aspects of it to keep it light-weighted), but more of a story. We will focus on the process and on what we learnt along the way. "

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bachelor's thesis of Ignacio was focused on the Spanish language, and datasets of misogyny in Spanish text is nothing but scarce. This was the first hardship: finding datasets to start training some models. Luckily, there is a very important community of shared tasks focused on the matter, covering a lot of non-English languages. We started working with data from [IberEval 2018](https://sites.google.com/view/ibereval-2â€¦), a shared-task that offered a compilation of tweets, analyzed by experts and classified into 5 different misogyny categories. We started training our first model with around three thousand instances of annotated data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, the [EXIST](http://nlp.uned.es/exist2021/) task at [IberLEF 2021](https://sites.google.com/view/iberlef2021) came to our sight. We saw there a perfect opportunity for our work on misogyny detection, for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   To test our approach on misogyny detection on a different subdomain, with different data.\n",
    "*   To search for data to expand our three-thousand-or-so instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "We covered our participation in the EXIST task in an [entry of our blogpost](https://medium.com/recognai/against-sexism-like-a-machine-2ae9227881ef). After we submitted our runs, we shifted our efforts towards integrating these new data into our corpus. The categorization was different: IberEval 2018 used a categorization system of 5 categories and 2 targets, but IberLEF 2021 didn't have a target field, and its categories were different. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the classic approach of Deep Learning, our journey would have ended there, with two different, incompatible datasets. But, thanks to Rubrix, it was only the beginning. "

For doing so, we needed a way to merge several annotations of the same instance into one, preserving the will of the majority, and that's when the Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) comes in handy.
