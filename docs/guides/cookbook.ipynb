    "In this quick guide, we are going to show you how easy can Rubrix be used side by side with some of the most popular AI Python libraries. Rubrix is *agnostic*, it can be used  with any library or framework, no need to implement any interface or modify your existing toolbox and workflows. With these few example you will be able to start loging and exploring your data for any of these libraries with just a glance, and maybe pick up some inspiration if your library of choice is not in this list.\n",
