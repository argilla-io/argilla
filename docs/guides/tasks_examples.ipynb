    "Text classification deals with predicting in which categories a text fits. As if you’re shown an image you could quickly tell if there’s a dog or a cat in it, we build NLP models to distinguish between a Jane Austen’s novel or a Charlotte Bronte’s poem. It’s all about feeding models with labeled examples and see how it start predicting over the very same labels."
