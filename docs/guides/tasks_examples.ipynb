As if you’re shown an image you could quickly tell if there’s a dog or a cat in it, we build NLP models to distinguish between a Jane Austen’s novel or a Charlotte Bronte’s poem. It’s all about feeding models with labelled examples and seeing how they start predicting over the very same labels."

It contains all explicit time references in a dataset of 52,183 novels whose full text is available via Project Gutenberg. From extracts of novels, we are surely going to find some NER entities.
