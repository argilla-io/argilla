    "## Rubrix weak supervision in a nutshell\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing weak supervision with Rubrix should be straightforward. Keeping the same spirit as other parts of the library, you can virtually use any weak supervision library or method, such as Snorkel or Flyingsquid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rubrix weak supervision support is built around two basic abstractions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Rule`\n",
    "A rule encodes an heuristic for labeling a record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heuristics can be defined using [Elasticsearch's queries](../reference/rubrix_webapp_reference.rst#search-input):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plz = Rule(query=\"plz OR please\", label=\"SPAM\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or with Python functions (similar to Snorkel's labeling functions, which you can use as well):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def contains_http(record: rb.TextClassificationRecord) -> Optional[str]:\n",
    "    if \"http\" in record.inputs[\"text\"]:\n",
    "        return \"SPAM\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides textual features, Python labeling functions can exploit metadata features:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def author_channel(record: rb.TextClassificationRecord) -> Optional[str]:\n",
    "    # the word channel appears in the comment author name\n",
    "    if \"channel\" in record.metadata[\"author\"]:\n",
    "        return \"SPAM\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A rule should either return a string value, that is a weak label, or a `None` type in case of abstention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Weak Labels`\n",
    "\n",
    "Weak Labels objects bundle and apply a set of rules to the records of a Rubrix dataset. Applying a rule to a record means assigning a weak label or abstaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "This abstraction provides you with the building blocks for training and testing weak supervision \"denoising\", \"label\" or even \"end\" models:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "rules = [contains_http, author_channel]\n",
    "weak_labels = WeakLabels(\n",
    "    rules=rules, \n",
    "    dataset=\"weak_supervision_yt\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# returns a summary of the applied rules\n",
    "weak_labels.summary()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More information about these abstractions can be found in [the Python Labeling module docs](../reference/python/python_labeling.rst).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical workflow to use weak supervision is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a Rubrix dataset with your raw dataset. If you actually have some labelled data you can log it into the the same dataset.\n",
    "2. Define a set of rules, exploring and trying out different things directly in the Rubrix web app.\n",
    "3. Create a `WeakLabels` object and apply the rules. Typically, you'll iterate between this step and step 2.\n",
    "4. Once you are satisfied with your weak labels, use the matrix of the `WeakLabels` instance with your library/method of choice to build a training set or even train a downstream text classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide shows you an end-to-end example using Snorkel and Flyingsquid. Let's get started!"

Highly popular options for this are [Snorkel](https://snorkel.org/) or [Flyingsquid](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flyingsquid). After this step, you can train a downstream model with the \"clean\" labels.\n",
