    "## 👨🏽‍🏫 Active Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "> Active learning is a special case of machine learning in which a learning algorithm can interactively query a user (or some other information source) to label new data points with the desired outputs. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning))\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised machine learning often requires large amounts of labeled data that are expensive to generate. \n",
    "*Active Learning* systems attempt to overcome this labeling bottleneck. \n",
    "The underlying idea is that not all data points are equally important for training the model. \n",
    "The *Active Learning* system tries to query only the most relevant data from a pool of unlabeled data to be labeled by a so-called *oracle*, which is often a human annotator.\n",
    "Therefore, *Active Learning* systems are usually much more sample efficient and need far less training data than traditional supervised systems.\n",
