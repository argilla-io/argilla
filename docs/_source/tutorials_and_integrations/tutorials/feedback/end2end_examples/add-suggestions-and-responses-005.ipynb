If we have a dataset that has been annotated already, we can add these gold responses to our dataset as responses. This comes in handy in that we will not have to annotate the dataset again. On the other hand, `suggestions` are the model predictions that we show to our annotators in the UI during the annotation process. This way, the annotation process will become much faster and easier for the annotators. \n",

    "**Deploy Argilla on Hugging Face Spaces:** If you want to run tutorials with external notebooks (e.g., Google Colab) and you have an account on Hugging Face, you can deploy Argilla on Spaces with a few clicks:\n",

    "In this tutorial, we have seen how we can add responses and suggestions to our dataset. Adding responses to your dataset given that you already have the annotated labels is a great way to save time and effort for your project. Similarly, adding suggestions to your dataset will make the annotation process much faster and easier for your annotators. We have seen how we can employ these tools for both `FeedbackDataset` and `RemoteFeedbackDataset`. Now, with the dataset we obtained, we can move on to [training our model](./train-model-006.ipynb) and [computing the metrics](./use-metrics-007.ipynb).
