    "# Use Metrics to Evaluate Your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of our end-to-end series, we will evaluate the annotation results of our dataset using the `metrics` module. To see the previous steps, you can refer to the tutorials such as [creating the dataset](./create-dataset-001.ipynb), [adding responses and suggestions](./add-resoponses) or [training your model](./train-model-006.ipynb). Feel free to check out the [practical guides](../../../../practical_guides/practical_guides.md) page for more in-depth information.\n",
    "\n",
    "After having your dataset annotated by the annotators, it is strongly recommended to evaluate the annotation results. Within the `metrics` module, we divide the evaluation metrics into three: Agreement Metrics, Suggestions Metrics, and Responses Metrics. **Agreement Metrics** are the metrics that you can employ to evaluate the agreement between the annotators. Generally referred to as \"Inter-Annotator Agreement\" in the literature, this metric has various implementations developed by different researchers, some notable examples of which are Krippendorff's Alpha, Cohen's Kappa, Fleiss' Kappa, Scott's Pi, and Bennet, Albert and Goldstein's S. With these metrics, you can see how reliable the annotations are and how much the annotators agree with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **Suggestions Metrics** are the metrics that you can employ to evaluate the responses of the annotators against the suggestions given to them. This will demonstrate how good the responses of each annotator are compared to a gold standard. In addition, we have the opportunity to unify the responses given by different annotators for a single record. This way, either the unified responses or responses can be evaluated. In a similar way, **Responses Metrics** are the metrics that you can employ to evaluate the suggestions given to the annotators against the responses given by them. This will give us an insight into how good the suggestions are, whether they are helpful or not, and whether the model needs to be improved."

    "In this tutorial, we have seen how we can evaluate the annotation results of our dataset using the `metrics` module. We have first unified the response to have a more comprehensive outlook on the annotations. Then, we have calculated the agreement metrics to see how much our annotators agree with each other. After that, we have calculated the suggestions metrics to see how good the responses of each annotator are compared to a gold standard, which is the suggestions in this case. Similarly, we have calculated the responses metrics to see how good the suggestions are compared to the responses of the annotators. \n",
    "\n",
    "For both suggestions and responses metrics, we have calculated the metrics per annotator and for the unified responses. If you feel that the annotations are not satisfactory, you can reiterate the annotation process by making changes in the structure of your project. You can refer to the [practical guides](../../../../practical_guides/practical_guides.md) to refine your structure or check out the [advanced tutorials](../../../../tutorials.md) to learn more about the advanced use cases of Argilla."
