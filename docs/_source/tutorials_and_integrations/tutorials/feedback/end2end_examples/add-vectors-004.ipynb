In this step, we will show how to set the vector settings and add the vectors, which allow the similarity search in the UI and PythonSDK. You can also take a look at our previous tutorials for [configuring the users and workspaces](./configure-users-and-workspaces-000.ipynb) and [creating a dataset](./create-dataset-001.ipynb) for a comprehensive overview of the complete workflow. Feel free to check out the [practical guides](../../../../practical_guides/practical_guides.md) page for more in-depth information and the [semantic search](../../../../practical_guides/annotation_workflows/semantic_search.md) page for more information about the similarity search.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we have seen how to add vectors to the dataset and do semantic search in the UI and PythonSDK. Vectors are a great way to restrict your dataset based on the similarity among the records. We have also seen how to push the dataset to Argilla and HuggingFace Hub. In the next tutorial, we will see how to [add suggestions and responses](./add-suggestions-and-responses-005.ipynb) to our dataset."
