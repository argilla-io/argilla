        "\n",
        "This guide explains how to fine-tune OpenAI's GPT3.5-turbo with your own data and Argilla to improve a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system. \n",
        "\n",
        "It includes the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Setting up a RAG pipeline using [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index) and [Unstructured](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured) to answer questions using a document about Argilla Cloud.\n",
        "- Generating potential questions with LlamaIndex to build a training and test set.\n",
        "- Building a dataset for collecting human written responses with Argilla.\n",
        "- Fine-tuning GPT3.5-turbo with high-quality data.\n",
        "- Evaluating the fine-tuned model vs. the base model with human preference data from Argilla.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of the tutorial is to demonstrate how to incorporate human feedback into your LLM development for two critical stages: \n",
        "\n",
        "1. Gathering **high-quality data for fine-tuning**, \n",
        "2. Gathering **human feedback for evaluation of LLM applications**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the ongoing debate between Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning, we selected a real-world RAG use case to demonstrate how fine-tuning enhances the style, utility, and relevance of responses within a RAG application. The resulting system will be a Hybrid RAG system (RAG using fine-tuned models) as [described in this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/rag-vs-finetuning-which-is-the-best-tool-to-boost-your-llm-application-94654b1eaba7). \n",
        "\n",
        "The screenshot below displays the evaluation dataset, termed the \"human preference dataset.\" In it, `response-a` is produced by the fine-tuned model, while `response-b` comes from the base GPT-3.5 model. With just minor fine-tuning and without altering the system message, we've directed the LLM's behavior towards generating responses that are more helpful, faithful, friendly, and aligned with our brand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning effectively mitigates common RAG challenges, like the LLM referring to the context using phrases such as \"The context does not provide information about this.\" This enhancement is notable even when we had incorporated directives in the system message to deter such references, like \"2. Avoid phrases such as 'Based on the context, ...' or 'The context information ...'.\" (see Llama Index default prompt later).\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also browse the [datasets hosted with Argilla Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/argilla/fine-tune-chat-gpt). User and password: argilla / 12345678. The dataset for this stage is `customer-assistant` and for the evaluation step is `finetuned-vs-base-preference`.\n",

service depend on the volume of records processed, with several tiers available to suit varying needs.Each tier has a corresponding monthly and annual price, with a 10% discount applied to the annual pricing option.The tier selection and associated price will be determined by the client's selection in the Service Order Form section of the Terms of Service document.Plans are: Starter 1 Million records Base 3 Million records Medium 4 Million records Large 6 million records\\n\\nSupport Argilla Cloud offers comprehensive support services to address various issues that may arise during the use of our service.Support levels are categorized into four distinct tiers, based on the severity of the issue, and a separate category for feature requests.The support process, response times, and procedures differ for each category.(1) Critical Issues Critical issues are characterized by: Severe impact on the Service, potentially rendering it completely non-functional.Disruption of critical service operations or functions.Obstruction of entire customer workflows.In the case of a critical issue, Argilla will: Assign specialist(s) to correct the issue on an expedited basis.Provide ongoing communication on the status via email and/or phone, according to the customer's preference.Begin work towards identifying a temporary workaround or fix.(2) Major Issues Major issues involve: Limited functionality of the Service.Service instability with periodic interruptions.Material service interruptions in mission-critical functions.Time-sensitive questions impacting performance or deliverables to end-clients.Upon encountering a major issue, Argilla will: Assign a specialist to begin a resolution.Implement additional, escalated procedures as reasonably determined necessary by Argilla Support Services staff.(3) Minor Issues Minor issues include: Errors causing partial, non-critical functionality loss.The need for clarification on procedures or information in documentation.Errors in service that may impact performance deliverables.(4) Trivial Issues Trivial issues are characterized by: Errors in system development with little to no impact on performance.Feature Requests Feature requests involve: Requesting a product enhancement.For feature requests, Argilla will: Respond regarding the relevance and interest in incorporating the requested feature.In summary, Argilla Cloud's support services are designed to provide timely and efficient assistance for issues of varying severity, ensuring a smooth and reliable user experience.All plans include Monday to Friday during office hours (8am to 17pm CEST) with additional support upon request.The Support Channels and features of each tier are shown below:\\n\\nStarter: Slack Community.Severity 1 - Response time < 4 hours.Severity 2 - Response time < 8 hours.Severity 3 - Response time < 48 hours.Severity 4 not specified.Base: Ticketing System, Severity 1 - Response time < 4 hours.Severity 2 - Response time < 8 hours.Severity 3 -

time < 24 hours.Severity 4 one week\\n\\nLarge: Ticketing System and dedicated Slack channel, Severity 1 - Response time < 4 hours.Severity 2 - Response time < 8 hours.Severity 3 - Response time < 24 hours.Severity 4 one week.Data backup and recovery plan Argilla Cloud is committed to ensuring the safety and availability of your data.Our system is designed to run six data backups per day as a standard procedure.These backups capture a snapshot of the system state at the time of the backup, enabling restoration to that point if necessary.Our Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is four hours.This means that in the event of a system failure, the maximum data loss would be up to the last four hours of data input.We achieve this by running regular backups throughout the day, reducing the time window of potential data loss.Our Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is one hour.This is the maximum acceptable length of time that your system could be down following a failure or disruption.It represents our commitment to ensuring that your services are restored as quickly as possible.In the event of a disruption, our team will first evaluate the issue to determine the best course of action.If data recovery is necessary, we will restore from the most recent backup.We will then work to identify and resolve the root cause of the disruption to prevent a recurrence.Finally, we conduct regular test restores to ensure that our backup system is working as intended.These tests verify the integrity of the backup data and the functionality of the restore process.\", \"This documents an overview of the Argilla Cloud service - a comprehensive Software as a Service (SaaS) solution for data labeling and curation.The service is specifically designed to meet the needs of businesses seeking a reliable, secure, and user-friendly platform for data management.The key components of our service include advanced security measures, robust data backup and recovery protocols, flexible pricing options, and dedicated customer support.The onboarding process is efficient, enabling clients to start using the service within one business day.The scope of this proposal includes details on the aforementioned aspects, providing a clear understanding of the service offerings and associated processes.Argilla Cloud offers four plans:\\n\\nStarter: Ideal for teams initiating their journey in scaling data curation and labelling projects.Perfect for environments where production monitoring is not a requirement.Base: Tailored for teams seeking to amplify their data curation, labelling efforts, and model monitoring, with enhanced support from Argilla.Medium: Designed for teams expanding their language model pipelines, requiring robust ML lifecycle management fortified by Argilla's comprehensive support.Large: Geared towards teams heavily dependent on language model pipelines, human feedback, and applications, requiring complete ML lifecycle management with robust support.Scope of services Argilla Cloud, a fully managed SaaS, encompasses the following functionalities: Unrestricted Users, Datasets, and Workspaces: The service imposes no limits on the number of users, datasets, or workspaces, supporting scalability of operations.Role-Based Access Control: Administrators and annotators have differentiated access rights to ensure structured and secure data management.Custom Subdomain: Clients are provided with a distinct argilla.io subdomain for accessing the platform.Regular Updates and Upgrades: The service includes regular platform patches and upgrades as part of routine maintenance to uphold system integrity and security.Managed Service: Infrastructure maintenance, backend operations, and other technical aspects are managed by Argilla, eliminating the need for client-side management.Security The security framework of the Argilla Cloud service involves a multi-faceted approach: Data Encryption at Rest: Data stored within the system is encrypted, forming a crucial layer of security.This process automatically encrypts data prior to storage, guarding against unauthorized access.Network Security Measures: The infrastructure has been designed to prevent unauthorized intrusion and to ensure consistent service availability.Measures include firewall protections, intrusion detection systems, and scheduled vulnerability scans to detect and address potential threats.Role-Based Access Control: The system implements role-based access control, defining access levels based on user roles.This mechanism controls the extent of access to sensitive information, aligning it with the responsibilities of each role.Security Audits: Regular audits of security systems and protocols are conducted to detect potential vulnerabilities and verify adherence to security standards.Employee Training: All personnel receive regular security training, fostering an understanding of the latest threats and the importance of security best practices.Incident Response Protocol: In the case of a security incident, a pre-defined incident response plan is activated.This plan outlines the procedures for managing different types of security events, and aims to ensure swift mitigation of potential damage.In summary, the security measures in place include data encryption, network security protocols, role-based access control, regular audits, employee training, and a comprehensive incident response plan.These measures contribute to a secure environment for data management.Setup and onboarding The process for setup and onboarding for Argilla Cloud is designed to be efficient and straightforward.The procedure involves a sequence of steps to ensure a smooth transition and optimal use of the service.Step 1: Account Creation The setup process begins with the creation of the client owner account.We require the client to provide the following details: Full name of the administrator Preferred username Administrator's email address Once these details are received, we send an onboarding email to sign up.Step 2: Platform Orientation Once logged in, the administrator has full access to the Argilla Cloud platform.They can familiarize themselves with the platform interface and various features.If required, a guided tour or tutorial can be provided to walk the administrator through the platform.Step 3: User Management The administrator is then responsible for setting up additional user accounts.They can invite users via email, manage roles (admin, annotator, etc.), and assign access permissions to different workspaces and datasets.Step 4: Workspace and Dataset Configuration The administrator can create and manage multiple workspaces and datasets.They have the option to configure settings as per their team's requirements, including assigning datasets to specific workspaces and managing access permissions.Step 5: Training and Support Argilla provides open resources and support to aid in the onboarding process.This includes user manuals, tutorials, and access to our support team for any queries or issues that may arise during the setup and onboarding process.By following these steps, new users can be quickly onboarded and begin using the Argilla Cloud service with minimal downtime.\"]\n"
