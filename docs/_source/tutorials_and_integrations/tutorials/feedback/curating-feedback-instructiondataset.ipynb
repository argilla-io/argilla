    "# 🖼️ Curate an instruction dataset for supervised fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The internet is flooded with open-source datasets for fine-tuning LLMs, some created by humans, others generated with generative models. However, these datasets often have many problematic and low-quality examples. By curating them, we can make the fine-tuning step more efficient.\n",

    "In this example, we will demonstrate how to replicate the [Databricks' Dolly dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/argilla/databricks-dolly-15k-curated-multilingual) cleaning effort started by the Argilla community. This will show how you can build an instruction dataset for your fine-tuning projects by cleaning a public dataset using Argilla's Feedback Task.\n",
