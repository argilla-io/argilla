    "# Ⓜ️ Finetuning LLMs as chat assistants: Supervised Finetuning on Mistral 7B\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to finetune a Large Language Model (LLM), Mistral 7B in particular, on a chat-style instruction dataset. We start with [mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1), an LLM that only does text completion, and we end up with our own [argilla/Mistral-7B-v0.1-chat-OIG](https://huggingface.co/argilla/Mistral-7B-v0.1-chat-OIG) model that faithfully follows instructions and acts as a helpful chat assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial consists of the following steps:\n",
    "1. Preparing a [FeedbackDataset](https://docs.v1.argilla.io/en/latest/conceptual_guides/data_model.html#feedback-dataset) in Argilla. <!-- using a public chat-style instruction dataset-->\n",
    "2. (Optional) Annotate instruction samples.\n",
    "3. Set up the [ArgillaTrainer](https://docs.v1.argilla.io/en/latest/practical_guides/fine_tune.html#supervised-finetuning) for Supervised Finetuning.\n",
    "4. Perform inference using the finetuned LLM.\n",
    "5. Publish the resulting model and dataset on the Hugging Face Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we used the `p3.8xlarge` AWS instance and trained for a total of 70 minutes. In terms of compute, training the Mistral chat model cost us less than $15."

    "In Argilla, the [FeedbackDataset](https://docs.v1.argilla.io/en/latest/conceptual_guides/data_model.html#feedback-dataset) is a powerful and widely-configurable class that is in charge of defining the annotation process. In particular, we define [fields](https://docs.v1.argilla.io/en/latest/conceptual_guides/data_model.html#field) and [questions](https://docs.v1.argilla.io/en/latest/conceptual_guides/data_model.html#question).\n",
    "\n",
    "The former is in charge of defining the structure for the data that will be annotated, while the latter determines in what way the annotators can annotate the data. In practice, `FeedbackDataset` instances for finetuning LLMs often have \"prompt\" and \"response\" text fields, sometimes alongside a \"context\" text field or some additional metadata (e.g. sample IDs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions provide a lot of flexibility - text questions allow annotators to provide better responses or suggestions to improve the prompt, while label questions may be used to select if a sample is considered \"good\" or not. With multi-label questions annotators can select whether samples are biased, harmful, incorrect, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend to set up the questions based on your goals and values for the annotation process. When preparing the training data, all of the annotations will be available, allowing you to carefully curate your training data. For example, based on your annotations you will be able to disregard samples that are (frequently) marked as harmful or low quality, or you can use the annotator-provided suggestions to responses or prompts instead of the existing ones.\n",
    "Furthermore, in some situations you may only have prompts to begin with, and you can use Argilla to request your annotators to provide responses. You can then use these in your training data.\n",

Additionally, we introduce a \"background\" text field, which is sometimes used to provide additional background information prior to the user prompt. An example data sample is shown a few cells below, to help clarify what the background entails. For the questions we will use one simple `LabelQuestion` that asks the annotator whether the response is `\"Good\"` or `\"Bad\"`."

    "Background: Tubulin in molecular biology can refer either to the tubulin protein superfamily of globular proteins, or one of the member proteins of that superfamily. α- and β-tubulins polymerize into microtubules, a major component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Microtubules function in many essential cellular processes, including mitosis. Tubulin-binding drugs kill cancerous cells by inhibiting microtubule dynamics, which are required for DNA segregation and therefore cell division. , there are six members of the tubulin superfamily, although not all are present in all species. Both α and β tubulins have a mass of around 50 kDa and are thus in a similar range compared to actin (with a mass of ~42 kDa). In contrast, tubulin polymers (microtubules) tend to be much bigger than actin filaments due to their cylindrical nature. Tubulin was long thought to be specific to eukaryotes. More recently, however, several prokaryotic proteins have been shown to be related to tubulin. <human>: What are some examples of drugs that bind to tubulin? <bot>: These include paclitaxel, colchicine, and the \"vinca\" alkaloids, each of which have a distinct binding site on β-tubulin. <human>: Are there any other examples? <bot>: In addition, the anti-worm drug albendazole selectively targets the colchicine site in worm, but not human or \"Drosophilia\", β-Tubulin. <human>: What is another specific example of a drug that binds to tubulin? <bot>: Class III β-tubulin is a microtubule element expressed exclusively in neurons, and is a popular identifier specific for neurons in nervous tissue. <human>: What is the difference between class III and other isotypes? <bot>: It binds colchicine much more slowly than other isotypes of β-tubulin. <human>: Are there six classes of isotypes? <bot>: β1-tubulin, sometimes called class VI β-tubulin, is the most divergent at the amino acid sequence level. <human>: What are the functions of the different isotypes? <bot>: It is expressed exclusively in megakaryocytes and platelets in humans and appears to play an important role in the formation of platelets.\n",

      "<human>: The neopositivists subscribed to a notion of philosophy as the conceptual clarification of the methods, insights and discoveries of the sciences. They saw in the logical symbolism elaborated by Frege (1848–1925) and Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) a powerful instrument that could rationally reconstruct all scientific discourse into an ideal, logically perfect, language that would be free of the ambiguities and deformations of natural language. This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein's idea that all logical truths are mere linguistic tautologies, they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the analytic (a priori) and the synthetic (a posteriori). On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the so-called verification principle. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning. As a result, most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered pseudoproblems.\n",

In particular, the data collation can be quite important, as some data collators will replace all special tokens (e.g. padding, BOS and EOS tokens) with a label of -100, which is the label that is ignored during training. If this is the case, then the model will not learn to produce the EOS token. Consequently, the model will always respond with endless tokens - far from ideal.\n",
