    "# ‚ùì Train a QnA model with transformers and Argilla\n",
    "\n",
    "At least once, you have probably found yourself in a situation where you need an answer to quite a specific question from Google. Chances are that Google gave you a response in bold letters (\"How much does the Eiffel Tower weigh? - 10,100 tons) or that Google only highlighted some text from the results (\"What was the original color of the Statue of Liberty?\"). Either way, Google used a specific algorithm that does the finding-the-answer job for you and saved you from reading a bunch of pages or using Ctrl+F. Although not confirming the reliability of the pages or the pieces of information found, it managed to come up with an exact answer to the question (it incorrectly highlights \"blue-green\" for the Statue of Liberty at the time of this post). This task -finding the exact answer in a piece of text for a given question- is called extractive question answering and it is one of the main pipelines of the many QnA or LLM systems today. In this blogpost, we will see how we can use Argilla to create an end-to-end pipeline for extractive QnA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps we will follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a dataset for extractive QnA\n",
    "- Add suggestions to the dataset\n",
    "- Push to Argilla and annotate\n",
    "- Define the model\n",
    "- Implement `ArgillaTrainer`\n",
    "- Train the model\n",
    "- Make predictions"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question answering (QnA)** tasks are mainly divided into two: extractive QnA and generative QnA. Generative QnA (or abstractive QnA) is the task where the QnA system generates human-like, natural language answers to a question. For this, a generative QnA system uses a retriever-generator architecture instead of a retriever-reader one, which is employed by an extractive QnA. As it requires a deeper understanding of the text and natural language generation, generative models are yet to catch the extractive ones in terms of performance as of today. However, as it offers a more sophisticated pipeline and output, it will have much more to offer in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the task we have just seen above was an example of the extractive QnA, where a model finds the exact span within a text that will be used as an answer to the given question. In this sense, this task formally consists of a tuple of (q,c,a) and the objective of training is to minimize the loss between *-log(Pstart)* and *-log(Pend)*, where *Pstart* and *Pend* are the probabilities of the start and end indices of the answer span.\n",
    "\n",
    "Argilla offers all the necessary tools from the start to the end of such a pipeline. We will use `Argilla` to annotate our dataset and use `ArgillaTrainer` to train the QnA model. `ArgillaTrainer` offers a smooth integration with `transformers`, which will allow you to implement your whole training process within the trainer itself. Let us first start by installing the required libraries and importing the necessary modules."

    "In this tutorial, we have seen how we can use Argilla to create an end-to-end pipeline for extractive QnA. We have first created a dataset for extractive QnA and added suggestions to it. Then, we have pushed the dataset to Argilla and annotated it. After that, we have defined the model and implemented the `ArgillaTrainer` to train the model. Finally, we have made predictions with the trained model. For more tutorials on other uses of Argilla and ArgillaTrainer, please refer to our [tutorials](../../../tutorials_and_integrations/tutorials/tutorials.md) page."
