    "\n",
    "- 💾 load a dataset with potential label errors, here we use the [ag_news](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ag_news) dataset;\n",
    "- 💻 train a model to make predictions for a test set, here we use a lightweight [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable//) model;\n",

    "As shown recently by [Curtis G. Northcutt et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14749) label errors are pervasive even in the most-cited test sets used to benchmark the progress of the field of machine learning.\n",
    "They introduce a new principled framework to “identify label errors, characterize label noise, and learn with noisy labels” called **confident learning**. \n",
    "It is open-sourced as the [cleanlab Python package](https://github.com/cgnorthcutt/cleanlab) that supports finding, quantifying, and learning with label errors in data sets.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Deploy Argilla on Hugging Face Spaces**: If you want to run tutorials with external notebooks (e.g., Google Colab) and you have an account on Hugging Face, you can deploy Argilla on Spaces with a few clicks:\n",

    "\n",
    "For details about configuring your deployment, check the [official Hugging Face Hub guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-argilla).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image**: This is the recommended option if you want [Argilla running on your local machine](/getting_started/quickstart_installation.html). Note that this option will only let you run the tutorial locally and not with an external notebook service.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Use the Open in Colab button at the top of this page. This option allows you to run the notebook directly on Google Colab. Don't forget to change the runtime type to GPU for faster model training and inference.\n",
