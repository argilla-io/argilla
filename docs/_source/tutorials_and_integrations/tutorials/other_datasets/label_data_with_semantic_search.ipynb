    "# 💨 Label data with semantic search and Sentence Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll learn to use Sentence Transformer embeddings and semantic search to make data labeling significantly faster. It will walk you through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 💾 use sentence transformers to generate embeddings of a dataset with banking customer requests\n",
    "- 🙃 upload the dataset into Argilla for data labeling\n",
    "- 🏷 use the similarity search feature to efficiently find a label bulk of semantically-related examples\n",

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll use the power of embeddings to make data labeling (and curation) more efficient. The idea of exploiting embeddings for labeling is not new, and there are several cool, standalone libraries to label data using embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `1.2.0`, Argilla gives you a way to leverage embedding-based similarity together with all other workflows already provided: search-based bulk labeling, programmatic labeling using search queries, model pre-annotation, and human-in-the-loop workflows. This also means you can combine keyword search and filters with this new similarity search feature. All these without any vendor or model lock-in, you can use ANY embedding or encoding method, including but not limited to `Sentence Transformers`, `OpenAI`, or `Co:here`. If you want a deep-dive, you can check the [Semantic similarity deep-dive](/tutorials/techniques/semantic_search.html), but this tutorial will show you the basics to get started. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Deploy Argilla on Hugging Face Spaces**: If you want to run tutorials with external notebooks (e.g., Google Colab) and you have an account on Hugging Face, you can deploy Argilla on Spaces with a few clicks:\n",

    "For details about configuring your deployment, check the [official Hugging Face Hub guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-argilla).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image**: This is the recommended option if you want [Argilla running on your local machine](/getting_started/quickstart_installation.html). Note that this option will only let you run the tutorial locally and not with an external notebook service.\n",

    "### Review records\n",
    "At this point, you can label the records one by one or scroll down to review them before using the bulk-labeling button on the top of the records list.\n",
