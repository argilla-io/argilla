    "# 🤯 Few-shot classification with SetFit\n",
    "\n",
    "**SetFit** is an exciting open-source package for Few-shot classification developed by teams at Hugging Face and Intel Labs. You can read all about it on the [project repository](https://github.com/huggingface/setfit). \n",
    "\n",
    "To showcase how powerful is **the combination of SetFit and Argilla**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We manually **label 55 examples** from the unlabelled split of the IMDb dataset, \n",
    "* we train a model in **5 min**, \n",
    "* and without using a single example from the original IMDb training set, we achieve a **0.9 accuracy on the full test set!**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll learn to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load a unlabelled dataset** in Argilla. We'll be using the unlabelled split from the `imdb` movie reviews sentiment dataset. This same workflow can be applied to any custom dataset, problem, and language!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Manually **label a FEW examples** using the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Train a SetFit model** to get highly competitive results. For this example, with **only 55 examples**, we get **0.9 accuracy** on the test set which is comparable to models fine-tuned on 3K examples. That means similar performance with `50x` less examples 🤯. \n",
    "\n",
    "For reference see the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/spaces/autoevaluate/leaderboards?dataset=imdb) and [PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/text-classification-on-imdb) leaderboards.\n",

    "## Running Argilla\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, you will need to have an Argilla server running. There are two main options for deploying and running Argilla:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deploy Argilla on Hugging Face Spaces**: If you want to run tutorials with external notebooks (e.g., Google Colab) and you have an account on Hugging Face, you can deploy Argilla on Spaces with a few clicks:\n",
    "\n",
    "[![deploy on spaces](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/raw/main/deploy-to-spaces-lg.svg)](https://huggingface.co/new-space?template=argilla/argilla-template-space)\n",
    "\n",
    "For details about configuring your deployment, check the [official Hugging Face Hub guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-argilla).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image**: This is the recommended option if you want [Argilla running on your local machine](/getting_started/quickstart_installation.html). Note that this option will only let you run the tutorial locally and not with an external notebook service.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on deployment options, please check the Deployment section of the documentation.\n",

    "Tip\n",
    "    \n",
    "This tutorial is a Jupyter Notebook. There are two options to run it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the Open in Colab button at the top of this page. This option allows you to run the notebook directly on Google Colab. Don't forget to change the runtime type to GPU for faster model training and inference.\n",
    "- Download the .ipynb file by clicking on the View source link at the top of the page. This option allows you to download the notebook and run it on your local machine or on a Jupyter Notebook tool of your choice.\n",
