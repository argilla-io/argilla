    "The basic idea is to use a pre-trained model to generate a vector representation for each relevant `TextFields` within the records. These vectors are then indexed within our databse and can then used to search based the similarity between texts. This should be useful for searching similar records based on the semantic meaning of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get these vectors and config, we will use the `SentenceTransformersExtractor` based on the [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/index.html) library. The default model we use for this is the [TaylorAI/bge-micro-v2](https://huggingface.co/TaylorAI/bge-micro-v2), which offers a nice trade-off between speed and accuracy, but you can use any model from the [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/index.html) library or from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?library=sentence-transformers)."

    "**Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image**: This is the recommended option if you want [Argilla running on your local machine](../../getting_started/quickstart.html). Note that this option will only let you run the tutorial locally and not with an external notebook service.\n",
