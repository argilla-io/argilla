    "# `llamaindex`: Build LLM applications with LlamaIndex and monitor the data with Argilla.\n",
    "\n",
    "This integration allows the user to include the feedback loop that Argilla offers into the LlamaIndex ecosystem. It's based on a callback handler to be run within the LlamaIndex workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "LlamaIndex is a specialized data framework tailored for supporting LLM-driven application development. It provides a sophisticated structure enabling developers to seamlessly integrate various data sources with large language models. These sources encompass diverse file formats like PDFs and PowerPoints, popular applications such as Notion and Slack, and databases like Postgres and MongoDB. Through a range of connectors, the framework streamlines data ingestion, facilitating smooth interactions with LLMs. Additionally, LlamaIndex offers an efficient interface for data retrieval and queries. This functionality allows developers to input LLM prompts and receive context-rich, knowledge-enhanced outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, LlamaIndex acts as an intermediary for managing interactions with an LLM by constructing an index from input data. This index is then leveraged to answer queries related to the provided data. LlamaIndex is flexible, capable of generating different types of indexes—vector, tree, list, or keyword indexes—tailored to specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "LlamaIndex offers a wide array of tools that facilitate the processes of data ingestion, retrievals, structuring, and integration with diverse application frameworks.\n",

    "For details about configuring your deployment, check the [official Hugging Face Hub guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-argilla).\n",
