    "# 🚀 Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! If you have just discovered Argilla this is the best place to get started. Argilla is composed of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Argilla Client**: a powerful Python library for reading and writing data into Argilla, using all the libraries you love (transformers, spaCy, datasets, and any other).\n",
    "* **Argilla Server and UI**: the API and UI for data annotation and curation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Launch the Argilla Server and UI.\n",
    "2. Pick a tutorial and start rocking with Argilla using Jupyter Notebooks, or Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get up and running with Argilla!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Argilla Quickstart\n",
    "For small scale projects and quick experimentation, there are two recommended ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 👩🏽‍🚀 Argilla on Hugging Face Spaces\n",
    "If you have a Hugging Face account and want to run Argilla workflows from Colab or remote notebooks, you can deploy the Argilla Server and UI on Hugging Face Spaces with this one-click deployment button:\n",
    "\n",
    "[![deploy on spaces](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/raw/main/deploy-to-spaces-md.svg)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/argilla/argilla-template-space)\\n\",\n",

    "<div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything goes well, you'll see your online Argilla UI login page. You can login with username `argilla` and password `1234`. You can find the direct URL by clicking on the Embed space button. You'll use this URL for sending data to your Argilla instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are now ready to start playing with Argilla! As the next step, we recommend [finding a tutorial](../tutorials/tutorials.html). Once you have a found a tutorial, you can (1) use the `Open in Colab` button to run Argilla workflows with free GPUs, or (2) download the notebook using the link `View source` at top-right corner of each tutorial page, and run it using VS Code, Jupyter Lab, or any other Jupyter IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to configure settings such as UI passwords and API keys, you can [follow this guide](installation/deployments/huggingface-spaces.md). This is completely optional step if you want to just quickly experiment with Argilla, but it's recommended for small projects as you can control who can browse, upload, and delete datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🐳 Argilla Quickstart with Docker\n",
    "If you want to run Argilla locally on your own computer, this is the easiest way to get Argilla UI up and running. With this option, you'll get some sample datasets to explore with Argilla UI, and a local Argilla UI running, which you can use to run your own Argilla data workflows using tools like VS Code or Jupyter Lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to install Docker on your machine. We recommend installing [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the Argilla quickstart container, you need to run this from your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "docker run -d --name quickstart -p 6900:6900 argilla/argilla-quickstart:latest\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything goes well, you can go to [http://localhost:6900](http://localhost:6900) and login with username `argilla` and password `1234`. You'll see several example datasets already pre-loaded. That means you are ready to start playing with Argilla! \n",
    "\n",
    "As the next step, we recommend [finding a tutorial](../tutorials/tutorials.md), downloading the notebook using the link `View source` at top-right corner of each tutorial page, and run it using VS Code, Jupyter Lab, or any other Jupyter IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details about setting up your Argilla Quickstart container [follow this guide](installation/deployments/docker-quickstart.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other deployment options and configurations\n",
    "Argilla is highly configurable and easy to deploy on different environments. If you are looking for more advanced deployment options and want to have a more production-ready setup, you can read the [Deployment](installation/deployments/deployments.md) and [Configuration](installation/configurations/configurations.md) guides."
