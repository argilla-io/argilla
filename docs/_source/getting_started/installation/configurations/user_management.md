# User Management

This guide explains how to set up and manage the users in Argilla via the Python client and the CLI.

:::{note}
The `User` class for user management has been included as of the Argilla 1.11.0 release and is not available in previous versions. But you will be able to use it with older Argilla instances, from 1.6.0 onwards, the only difference will be that the main role is now `owner` instead of `admin`.
:::

:::{warning}
As of Argilla 1.11.0, the default pool of users in the quickstart contains also an owner user which uses the credentials: username `owner`, password `12345678`, and API key `owner.apikey`; while for the server image the default user is now an `owner` instead of an `admin` with the same credentials: username `argilla`, password `1234` and API key `argilla.apikey`.
:::

## User Model

A user in Argilla is an authorized person who can access the UI and use the Python client and CLI in a running Argilla instance.

We differentiate between three types of users depending on their role, permissions, and needs: `owner`, `admin`, `annotator`.

### Owner

The owner is the root user who created the Argilla instance. When working with Argilla, it is very useful to work with workspaces. So, the owner has full access to all workspaces and their options:

An Argilla user is composed of the following attributes:
- **Workspace management**: It can create and delete a workspace.
- **User management**: It can create a new user, update its information, assign a workspace to a user, and delete a user. It can also list all of them and search for a specific user by its name or ID.
- **Dataset management**: It can create, configure, update, and delete datasets. It can also delete the current FeedbackDataset from Argilla.
- **Annotation**: It can annotate datasets in the Argilla UI.
- **Feedback**: It can provide feedback with the Argilla UI.

### Admin

An admin user can only access the workspaces it has been assigned to and cannot assign other users to it. An admin user has the following permissions:

- **Dataset management**: It can create, configure, update, and delete datasets (including FeedbackDataset) only on assigned workspaces.
- **Annotation**: It can annotate datasets in the assigned workspaces via the Argilla UI.
- **Feedback**: It can provide feedback with the Argilla UI.

### Annotator

An annotator user is limited to accessing only the datasets assigned to it within the workspace. It has two specific permissions:

- **Annotation**: It can annotate datasets in the Argilla UI.
- **Feedback**: It can provide feedback with the Argilla UI.

![user_roles_schema](/_static/images/installation/user_management/user_roles.png)

An Argilla user is composed of the following attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `UUID` | The unique identifier of the user. |
| `username` | `str` | The username used as login for Argilla's UI. |
| `first_name` | `str` | The user's first name. |
| `last_name` | `str` | The user's last name. |
| `full_name` | `str` | The user's full name, which is the concatenation of `first_name` and `last_name`. |
| `role` | `str` | The user's role in Argilla. Available roles are: "owner", "admin" and "annotator". |
| `workspaces` | `List[str]` | The workspace names where the user has read and write access (both from the UI and the Python client). |
| `api_key` | `str` | The API key to interact with Argilla API, mainly through the Python client but also via HTTP for advanced users. It is automatically generated when a user is created. |
| `inserted_at` | `datetime` | The date and time when the user was created. |
| `updated_at` | `datetime` | The date and time when the user was last updated. |

### Python client

The `User` class in the Python client gives developers with `owner` role the ability to create and manage users in Argilla. Check the [User - Python Reference](/reference/python/python_users.rst) to see the attributes, arguments, and methods of the `User` class.

## How to guide

:::{note}
To connect to an old Argilla instance (`<1.3.0`) using newer clients, you should specify the default user API key `rubrix.apikey`. Otherwise, connections will fail with an Unauthorized server error.
:::

### Get the currently active `User`

You can get the currently active user in Argilla using the `me` classmethod in the `User` class. Note that the `me` method will return the active user as specified via the credentials provided via `rg.init`. Also, it is possible to [set this information using environment variables](/getting_started/installation/configurations/server_configuration.md#client), which allows for skipping `rg.init`.

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} CLI

```bash
argilla login --api-url http://localhost:6900
argilla whoami
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Python client

```python

import argilla as rg

rg.init(api_url="<ARGILLA_API_URL>", api_key="<ARGILLA_API_KEY>")

user = rg.User.me()
```

:::

::::

### Create a `User`

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} CLI
You can create a new user in Argilla using the `create` command in the `users` group.

```bash
argilla users create
```

So for example, to create a new user with `admin` role and member of `ws1` and `ws2` workspaces, you can run the following command:

```bash
argilla users create --username new-user --password new-password --first-name New --last-name User --role admin --workspace ws1 --workspace ws2
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Python client
You can also create a new user in Argilla using the `create` classmethod in the `User` class. The provided workspaces must exist in Argilla.

```python
import argilla as rg

rg.init(api_url="<ARGILLA_API_URL>", api_key="<ARGILLA_API_KEY>")

user = rg.User.create(
    username="new-user",
    first_name="New",
    last_name="User",
    password="new-password",
    role="admin",
    workspaces=["ws1", "ws2"]
)
```

:::

::::

### Update a `User`

You can change the assigned role for an existing user using the database connection, therefore the environment variable `ARGILLA_DATABASE_URL` must be set unless you're using SQLite in which case you should be executing the command from the machine where the Argilla server is running.

```bash
argilla server database users update argilla --role owner
```

```bash
User 'argilla' successfully updated:
â€¢ role: 'admin' -> 'owner'
```

:::{note}
You should use this command to review and migrate user roles from version `<=1.10.0`
:::

### Get a `User` by username

#### Python client

You can get a user by username using the `from_name` classmethod in the `User` class.

```python
import argilla as rg

rg.init(api_url="<API_URL>", api_key="<OWNER_API_KEY>")

user = rg.User.from_name("new-user")
```

### Get a `User` by id

#### Python client

You can get a user by id using the `from_id` classmethod in the `User` class.

```python
import argilla as rg

rg.init(api_url="<ARGILLA_API_URL>", api_key="<ARGILLA_API_KEY>")

user = rg.User.from_id("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000")
```

### Assign a `User` to a `Workspace`

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} CLI

You can assign a user to a workspace using the `add-user` command in the `workspace` group.

```bash
argilla workspace --name ws1 add-user nick
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Python client
To assign a user to a workspace, you can use the `add_user` method in the `Workspace` class. For more information about workspaces, see the [Workspace Management](./workspace_management.md) guide.

```python
import argilla as rg

rg.init(api_url="<API_URL>", api_key="<OWNER_API_KEY>")

user = rg.User.create(
    username="nick",
    first_name="Nick",
    last_name="Name",
    password="11223344",
    role="annotator",
)

workspace = rg.Workspace.create(name="ws")
workspace.add_user(user.id)
```

:::

::::

### List `Users`

:::{note}
Just the "owner" can list all the users in Argilla.
:::

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} CLI

You can list all the existing users in Argilla using the `list` command in the `users` group.

```bash
argilla users list
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Python client

You can list all the existing users in Argilla by calling the `list` classmethod of the `User` class.

```python
import argilla as rg

rg.init(api_url="<API_URL>", api_key="<OWNER_API_KEY>")

users = rg.User.list()
```

:::

::::

### Delete a `User`

:::{note}
Just the "owner" can delete users in Argilla.
:::

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} CLI

You can delete an existing user in Argilla using the `delete` command in the `users` group.

```bash
argilla users --username existing-user delete
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Python client

You can delete an existing user from Argilla by calling the `delete` method on the `User` class.

```python
import argilla as rg

rg.init(api_url="<ARGILLA_API_URL>", api_key="<ARGILLA_API_KEY>")

user = rg.User.from_name("existing-user")
user.delete()
```

:::

::::

### Default user for the `argilla/argilla-server` Docker image

If you're using the `argilla/argilla-server` Docker image, you can create the default user `argilla` with `owner` role by setting the following environment variables:

- `DEFAULT_USER_ENABLED`: Set to `true` to enable the default user creation.
- `DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD`: If `DEFAULT_USER_ENABLED` is set to `true`, this environment variable must be set to the password for the default user.
- `DEFAULT_USER_API_KEY`: If `DEFAULT_USER_ENABLED` is set to `true`, this environment variable must be set to the API key for the default user.

### Migrate users from the `users.yaml` file

The migration command can create users and workspaces automatically from a YAML file with the following format:

```yaml
- username: john
  full_name: John Doe
  email: john@argilla.io
  api_key: a14427ea-9197-11ec-b909-0242ac120002
  hashed_password: $2y$05$xtl7iy3bpqchUwiQMjEHe.tY7OaIjDrg43W3TB4EHQ7izvdjvGtPS
  disabled: False

- username: tanya
  full_name: Tanya Franklin
  email: tanya@argilla.io
  api_key: 78a10b53-8db7-4ab5-9e9e-fbd4b7e76551
  hashed_password: $2y$05$aqNyXcXRXddNj5toZwT0HugHqKZypvqlBAkZviAGGbsAC8oTj/P5K
  workspaces: [argilla, team]
  disabled: True

- username: daisy
  full_name: Daisy Gonzalez
  email: daisy@argilla.io
  api_key: a8168929-8668-494c-b7a5-98cd35740d9b
  hashed_password: $2y$05$l83IhUs4ZDaxsgZ/P12FO.RFTi2wKQ2AxMK2vYtLx//yKramuCcZG
  workspaces: [argilla, team, latam]
  disabled: False
```

To do so, the command will connect to the Argilla server database directly, therefore the environment variable `ARGILLA_DATABASE_URL` must be set unless you're using SQLite in which case you should be executing the command from the machine where Argilla server is running.

The user role will be computed depending on how workspaces are set up for each user. If no `workspace` attribute is defined, the user will be considered an `owner`. Otherwise, the assigned user role will be `annotator`.

The task will also create an extra workspace for each user named after their username.

```bash
export ARGILLA_LOCAL_AUTH_USERS_DB_FILE=/path/to/.users.yml
argilla server database users migrate
```

```bash
Starting users migration process using file '.users.yml'
Migrating User with username 'john'
Migrating User with username 'tanya'
Migrating User with username 'daisy'
Users migration process successfully finished
```

Ensure everything went as expected logging in and listing the users via the CLI:

```bash
argilla users list
```

### Migrate users with Docker Compose

Make sure you create the YAML file above in the same folder as your `docker-compose.yaml`. You can download the `docker-compose.yaml` file from this [URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argilla-io/argilla/main/docker/docker-compose.yaml):

Then open the provided `docker-compose.yaml` file and modify your Argilla instance as follows:

```diff
  argilla:
    image: argilla/argilla-server:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "6900:6900"
    environment:
      ARGILLA_HOME_PATH: /var/lib/argilla
      ARGILLA_ELASTICSEARCH: http://elasticsearch:9200
      ARGILLA_AUTH_SECRET_KEY: ${ARGILLA_AUTH_SECRET_KEY:? Please generate a 32 character random string with `openssl rand -hex 32`}
+     ARGILLA_LOCAL_AUTH_USERS_DB_FILE: /var/lib/argilla-migrate/users.yaml
    networks:
      - argilla
    volumes:
      - argilladata:/var/lib/argilla
+     - ${PWD}/users.yaml:/var/lib/argilla-migrate/users.yaml
```

After that change you can start the containers with:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

And, after running the containers you can run the task to migrate the users as follows:

```bash
docker-compose exec argilla argilla server database users migrate
```

If everything goes well, the configured users can now log in, their annotations will be tracked with their usernames, and they'll have access to the defined workspaces.
