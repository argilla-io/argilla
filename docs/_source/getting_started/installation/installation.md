# Setup and installation

In this guide, we will help you to get up and running with Argilla.
Basically, you need to:

1. Install Argilla
2. Launch the web app
3. Start logging data

## 1. Install Argilla

First, make sure you have Python 3.7 or above installed.

Then you can install Argilla with `pip`:

{{ '```bash\npip install "argilla[server]{}"\n```'.format(pipversion) }}

## 2. Install Elasticsearch or Opensearch
You need to launch Argilla's database. Argilla supports two backend databases: Elasticsearch and Opensearch.

If you donâ€™t have Elasticsearch (ES) or Opensearch running we recommend you to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for your plattform.

<div class="alert alert-info">

Note

Check the [setup and installation section](./installation/installation.md) for further options and configurations regarding Elasticsearch and Opensearch.
</div>

Now you can launch Elasticsearch or Opensearch using `docker-compose` as follows:

### Opensearch
You can launch Opensearch with Docker as follows:
```bash

mkdir argilla & cd argilla
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argilla-io/argilla/main/docker-compose.opensearch.yaml
docker-compose up -d

```

Alternatively, you can download the [docker-compose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argilla-io/argilla/main/docker-compose.opensearch.yaml) manually and then run:

```bash

docker-compose -f docker-compose.opensearch.yaml up

```

### Elasticsearch
You can launch Elasticsearch with Docker as follows:
```bash

mkdir argilla & cd argilla
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argilla-io/argilla/main/docker-compose.elasticsearch.yaml
docker-compose up -d

```
Alternatively, you can download the [docker-compose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argilla-io/argilla/main/docker-compose.elasticsearch.yaml) manually and then run:

```bash

docker-compose -f docker-compose.elasticsearch.yaml up

```

## 3. Prepare database

First of all, you need to make sure that database tables and models are up-to-date. This task must be launched when a new version of Argilla is installed. This will prepare some default ables for storing the data and user info.

```bash
python -m argilla database migrate
```

```
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl SQLiteImpl.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume non-transactional DDL.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade  -> 74694870197c, create users table
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade 74694870197c -> 82a5a88a3fa5, create workspaces table
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade 82a5a88a3fa5 -> 1769ee58fbb4, create workspaces_users table
```

## 4. Launch Argilla Server


You can start the Argilla Server and UI by running:

```bash

python -m argilla

```

Afterward, you should be able to access the Argilla UI at [http://localhost:6900/](http://localhost:6900/).
**The default username and password are** `argilla` **and** `1234` (see the [user management guide](user-management.ipynb) to configure this).

:::{note}
You can also launch the Argilla Server and UI using [docker](launching-the-web-app-via-docker) or [docker-compose](launching-the-web-app-via-docker-compose).
For the latter you do not need a running ES instance.

## 5. Start logging data

The following code will log one record into a data set called `example-dataset`:

```python
import argilla as rg

rg.log(
    rg.TextClassificationRecord(text="My first Argilla example"),
    name='example-dataset'
)
```

If you now go to your Argilla app at [http://localhost:6900/](http://localhost:6900/), you will find your first data set.
