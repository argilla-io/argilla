# Google Colab
Google Colab is a free tool that allows users to run and share Jupyter notebooks on Google's servers. It can be useful for quickly trying out models and using GPUs for training and prediction tasks. In the context of Argilla, it can be used for experimenting with pre-trained models, active learning, and computing text embeddings.

To use Argilla with Google Colab, the recommended method is to use Hugging Face Spaces, as [described in this guide](huggingface-spaces.md). This is the easiest way to set up Argilla for use with Google Colab. For other installations, we recommend you to read the [cloud providers guide](cloud_providers.md).

If you are looking for an end-to-end example using Google Colab and Hugging Face Spaces, check out this [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GeBBuRw8CIZ6SYql5Vdx4Q2Vv74eFa1I?usp=sharing).
