## Feedback Dataset

```{include} /_common/feedback_dataset.md
```

### Filter

From Argilla 1.15.0, the `filter_by` method has been included for the `FeedbackDataset`s pushed to Argilla, which allows you to filter the records in a dataset based on the `response_status` of the annotations of the records. So on, to be able to use the `filter_by` method, you will need to make sure that you are using a `FeedbackDataset` in Argilla.

:::{warning}
The `filter_by` method returns a new instance which is a `FeedbackDataset` with the filtered records and synced with Argilla, which means that you will just have access to the records that are compliant with the applied filter. So calling `filter_by` will return a `FeedbackDataset` with a subset of the records, but the records won't be modified unless updates or deletions are specifically applied at record-level. So on, the following methods are not allowed: `delete`, `delete_records`, `add_records`, `records.add`, and `records.delete`; while you'll still be able to perform record-level operations such as `update` or `delete`.
:::

#### By `fields` content

In the UI, you can filter records based on the content in their fields using the searchbar in the top left corner on top of the record card. For example, you may read or annotate all records mentioning John Wick by simply typing "John Wick" in the searchbar. If your records have multiple fields, you will be able to select a specific field for the search or select "All" if you'd like to search on all fields. Matches are shown in <span style="color:#ff675f">coral</span>.

#### By metadata property

In the UI, you will find a metadata filter that lets you easily set a combination of filters based on the metadata properties defined for your dataset.

```{note}
Note that if a metadata property was set to `visible_for_annotators=False` this metadata property will only appear in the metadata filter for users with the `admin` or `owner` role.
```

In the Python SDK, you can also filter the records using one or a combination of metadata filters for the metadata properties defined in your dataset. Depending on the type of metadata you want to filter by, you will need to choose one of the following: `IntegerMetadataFilter`, `FloatMetadataFilter` or `TermsMetadataFilter`.

These are the arguments that you will need to define for your filter:

- `name`: The name of the metadata property you want to filter by.
- `ge`: In an `IntegerMetadataFilter` or `FloatMetadataFilter`, match values greater than or equal to the provided value. At least one of `ge` or `le` should be provided.
- `le`: In an `IntegerMetadataFilter` or `FloatMetadataFilter`, match values lower than or equal to the provided value. At least one of `ge` or `le` should be provided.
- `values`: In a `TermsMetadataFilter`, returns records with at least one of the values provided.

```python
import argilla as rg

rg.init(api_url="<ARGILLA_API_URL>", api_key="<ARGILLA_API_KEY>")

dataset = rg.FeedbackDataset.from_argilla(name="my-dataset", workspace="my-workspace")

filtered_records = dataset.filter_by(
    metadata_filters=[
        rg.IntegerMetadataFilter(
            name="tokens-length",
            ge=900, # at least one of ge or le should be provided
            le=1000
        ),
        rg.TermsMetadataFilter(
            name="task",
            values=["summarization", "information-extraction"]
        )
    ]
)
```

#### By response

Within the UI filters, you can filter records according to the value of responses given by **the current user**.

```{note}
This is available for responses to questions of the following types: `LabelQuestion`, `MultiLabelQuestion` and `RatingQuestion`.
```

#### By suggestion

In the Argilla UI, you can filter your records based on suggestions. When these are available, it is possible to filter by suggestion score, value and agent.

```{note}
This is available for suggestions to questions of the following types: `LabelQuestion`, `MultiLabelQuestion` and `RatingQuestion`.
```

#### By status

In the UI, you can find a status selector that will let you choose a queue of records depending on the status of responses given by **the current user**. Here you can choose to see records with `Pending`, `Discarded` or `Submitted` responses.

In the Python SDK, the `filter_by` method allows you to filter the records in a dataset based on the `response_status` of the responses given by **all users**. The `response_status` of an annotation can be one of the following:

- `pending`: The records with this status have no responses. In the UI, they will appear under the `Pending` queue.
- `draft`: The records with this status have responses that have been saved as a draft, not yet submitted or discarded. In the UI, they will appear under the `Draft` queue.
- `discarded`: The records with this status may or may not have responses but have been discarded by the annotator. In the UI, they will appear under the `Discarded` queue.
- `submitted`: The records with this status have responses already submitted by the annotator. In the UI, they will appear under the `Submitted` queue.

:::{note}
From Argilla 1.14.0, calling `from_argilla` will pull the `FeedbackDataset` from Argilla, but the instance will be remote, which implies that the additions, updates, and deletions of records will be pushed to Argilla as soon as they are made. This is a change from previous versions of Argilla, where you had to call `push_to_argilla` again to push the changes to Argilla.
:::

You can either filter the records by a single status or by a list of statuses.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} single status

For example, to filter the records by the status "submitted", you can do the following:

```python
import argilla as rg

rg.init(api_url="<ARGILLA_API_URL>", api_key="<ARGILLA_API_KEY>")

dataset = rg.FeedbackDataset.from_argilla(name="my-dataset", workspace="my-workspace")
filtered_dataset = dataset.filter_by(response_status="submitted")
```

:::

:::{tab-item} list of statuses
To filter the records by a list of statuses, you can do the following:

```python
import argilla as rg

rg.init(api_url="<ARGILLA_API_URL>", api_key="<ARGILLA_API_KEY>")

dataset = rg.FeedbackDataset.from_argilla(name="my-dataset", workspace="my-workspace")
filtered_dataset = dataset.filter_by(response_status=["submitted", "draft"])
```

:::
::::

### Sort

You may also order your records according to one or several attributes, including insertion and last update time, suggestion scores, response and suggestion values for Rating questions and metadata properties. In the UI, you can easily do this using the `Sort` menu.

In the Python SDK, you can do this sorting with the `sort_by` method using the following arguments:

- `field`: This refers to the information that will be used for the sorting. This can be the time when a record was created (`created_at`), last updated (`updated_at`) or any metadata properties configured for your dataset (`metadata.my-metadata-name`).
- `order`: Whether the order should be ascending (`asc`) or descending (`des`).

```python
sorted_records = remote.sort_by(
    [
        SortBy(field="metadata.my-metadata", order="asc"),
        SortBy(field="updated_at", order="des"),
    ]
)
```

```{tip}
You can also combine filters and sorting: `dataset.filter_by(...).sort_by(...)`
```

### Semantic search

```{include} /_common/ui_feedback_semantic_search.md
```

```{include} /_common/sdk_feedback_semantic_search.md
```

## Other datasets

```{include} /_common/other_datasets.md
```

The search in Argilla is driven by Elasticsearch's powerful [query string syntax](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax).
It allows you to perform simple fuzzy searches of words and phrases, or complex queries taking full advantage of Argilla's data model.

The same query can be used in the search bar of the Argilla web app, or with the Python client as optional arguments.

```python
import argilla as rg

rg.load("my_dataset", query="text.exact:example")
```

Also, we provide a brief summary of the syntax, but for a complete overview, dive deep into the docs below.

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} text and inputs

The `text` field uses Elasticsearch's [standard analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/analysis-standard-analyzer.html) that ignores capitalization and removes most of the punctuation;
The `text.exact` field uses the [whitespace analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/analysis-whitespace-analyzer.html) that differentiates between lower and upper case, and does take into account punctuation;

- `text:dog.` or `text:fox`: matches both of the records.
- `text.exact:dog` or `text.exact:FOX`: matches none of the records.
- `text.exact:dog.` or `text.exact:fox`: matches only the first record.
- `text.exact:DOG` or `text.exact:FOX\!`: matches only the second record.

Similar reasoning holds for the `inputs` to look for records in which the *subject*-key contains the word *news*, you would search for

- `inputs.subject:news`

Again, as with the `text` field, you can also use the white space analyzer to perform more fine-grained searches by specifying the `exact` field.

- `inputs.subject.exact:NEWS`

:::

:::{tab-item} metadata and filters

Imagine you provided the split to which the record belongs as metadata, that is `metadata={"split": "train"}` or `metadata={"split": "test"}`.
Then you could only search your training data by specifying the corresponding field in your query:

- `metadata.split:train`

Just like the metadata, you can also use the filter fields in your query.
A few examples to emulate the filters in the query string are:

- `status:Validated`
- `annotated_as:HAM`
- `predicted_by:Model A`

Ranges can be specified for date, numeric or string fields.
Inclusive ranges are specified with square brackets and exclusive ranges are with curly brackets:

- `score:[0.5 TO 0.6]`
- `score:{0.9 TO *}`
- `event_timestamp:[1984-01-01T01:01:01.000000 TO *]`
- `last_updated:{* TO 1984-01-01T01:01:01.000000}`

![text2text_record](/_static/reference/webapp/features-search.png)
:::

:::{tab-item} operators

You can combine an arbitrary amount of terms and fields in your search using the familiar boolean operators `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`.
The following examples showcase the power of these operators:

- `text:(quick AND fox)`: Returns records that contain the word *quick* and *fox*. The `AND` operator is the default operator, so `text:(quick fox)` is equivalent.
- `text:(quick OR brown)`: Returns records that contain either the word *quick* or *brown*.
- `text:(quick AND fox AND NOT news)`: Returns records that contain the words *quick* and *fox*, **and do not** contain *news*.
- `metadata.split:train AND text:fox`: Returns records that contain the word *fox* and that have the metadata *"split: train"*.
- `NOT _exists_:metadata.split` : Returns records that don't have a metadata *split*.

![text2text_record](/_static/reference/webapp/features-search.png)
:::

:::{tab-item} regex

Regular expression patterns can be embedded in the query string by wrapping them in forward slashes "/":

- `text:/joh?n(ath[oa]n)/`: Matches *jonathon*, *jonathan*, *johnathon*, and *johnathan*.

The supported regular expression syntax is explained in the official [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/regexp-syntax.html).

![text2text_record](/_static/reference/webapp/features-search.png)
:::

:::{tab-item} fuzzy

You can search for terms that are similar to, but not exactly like the search terms, using the *fuzzy* operator.
This is useful to cover human misspellings:

- `text:quikc~`: Matches quick and quikc.

![text2text_record](/_static/reference/webapp/features-search.png)
:::

:::{tab-item} wildcards

Wildcard searches can be run on individual search terms, using `?` to replace a single character, and `*` to replace zero or more characters:

- `text:(qu?ck bro*)`
- `text.exact:"Lazy Dog*"`: Matches, for example, *"Lazy Dog"*, *"Lazy Dog."*, or *"Lazy Dogs"*.
- `inputs.\*:news`: Searches all input fields for the word *news*.

![text2text_record](/_static/reference/webapp/features-search.png)

### Search fields

An important concept when searching with Elasticsearch is the *field* concept.
Every search term in Argilla is directed to a specific field of the record's underlying data model.
For example, writing `text:fox` in the search bar will search for records with the word `fox` in the field `text`.

If you do not provide any fields in your query string, by default Argilla will search in the `text` field.
For a complete list of available fields and their content, have a look at the field glossary below.

```{note}
The default behavior when not specifying any fields in the query string changed in version `>=0.16.0`.
Before this version, Argilla searched in a mixture of the the deprecated `word` and `word.extended` fields that allowed searches for special characters like `!` and `.`.
If you want to search for special characters now, you have to specify the `text.exact` field.
For example, this is the query if you want to search for words with an exclamation mark at the end: `text.exact:*\!`

If you do not retrieve any results after a version update, you should use the `words` and `words.extended` fields in your search query for old datasets instead of the `text` and `text.exact` ones.
```

### `text` and `text.exact`

The (arguably) most important fields are the `text` and `text.exact` fields.
They both contain the text of the records, however in two different forms:

- the `text` field uses Elasticsearch's [standard analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/analysis-standard-analyzer.html) that ignores capitalization and removes most of the punctuation;
- the `text.exact` field uses the [whitespace analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/analysis-whitespace-analyzer.html) that differentiates between lower and upper case, and does take into account punctuation;

Let's have a look at a few examples.
Suppose we have 2 records with the following text:

1. *The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.*
2. *THE LAZY DOG HATED THE QUICK BROWN FOX!*

Now consider these queries:

- `text:dog.` or `text:fox`: matches both of the records.
- `text.exact:dog` or `text.exact:FOX`: matches none of the records.
- `text.exact:dog.` or `text.exact:fox`: matches only the first record.
- `text.exact:DOG` or `text.exact:FOX\!`: matches only the second record.

You can see how the `text.exact` field can be used to search in a more fine-grained manner.

#### TextClassificationRecord's `inputs`

For [text classification records](/reference/python/python_client.rst) you can take advantage of the multiple `inputs` when performing a search.
For example, if we uploaded records with `inputs={"subject": ..., "body": ...}`, you can direct your searches to only one of those inputs by specifying the `inputs.subject` or `inputs.body` field in your query.
So to look for records in which the *subject* contains the word *news*, you would search for

- `inputs.subject:news`

Again, as with the `text` field, you can also use the white space analyzer to perform more fine-grained searches by specifying the `exact` field:

- `inputs.subject.exact:NEWS`

### Words and phrases

Apart from single words you can also search for *phrases* by surrounding multiple words with double quotes.
This searches for all the words in the phrase, in the same order.

If we take the two examples from above, then the following query will only return the second example:

- `text:"lazy dog hated"`

### Metadata fields

You also have the metadata of your records available when performing a search.
Imagine you provided the split to which the record belongs as metadata, that is `metadata={"split": "train"}` or `metadata={"split": "test"}`.
Then you could only search your training data by specifying the corresponding field in your query:

- `metadata.split:train`

Metadata are indexed as keywords.
This means you cannot search for single words in them, and capitalization and punctuation are taken into account.
You can, however, use wild cards.

```{warning}
The metadata field has by default a maximum length of 128 characters and a field limit of 50. If you wish to change these values, you can do so by setting your own `ARGILLA_METADATA_FIELD_LENGTH` in the server environment variables. Learn more [here](/getting_started/installation/configurations/server_configuration.md)
The metadata field has by default a maximum length of 128 characters and a field limit of 50. If you wish to change these values, you can do so by setting your own `ARGILLA_METADATA_FIELD_LENGTH` in the server environment variables. Learn more [here](/getting_started/installation/configurations/server_configuration.md)
```

#### Non-searchable metadata fields

If you intend to only store metadata with records and not use it for searches, you can achieve this by defining
the metadata field with a leading underscore. For instance, if you use `metadata._my_hidden_field`, the field will be
accessible at the record level, but it won't be used in searches.

```{hint}
You can use this field to add an image to your record by pointing to its URL like so:
`metadata = {"_image_url": "https://..."}`

Note that the URL cannot exceed the metadata length limit.
```

### Vector fields

It is also possible to query the presence of vector field. Imagine you only want to include records with `vectors={"vector_1": vector_1}`. You can then define a query `vectors.vector_1: *`.

### Filters as query string

Just like the metadata, you can also use the filter fields in your query.
A few examples to emulate the filters in the query string are:

- `status:Validated`
- `annotated_as:HAM`
- `predicted_by:Model A`

The field values are treated as keywords, that is you cannot search for single words in them, and capitalization and punctuation are taken into account.
You can, however, use wild cards.

### Combine terms and fields

You can combine an arbitrary amount of terms and fields in your search using the familiar boolean operators `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`.
The following examples showcase the power of these operators:

- `text:(quick AND fox)`: Returns records that contain the word *quick* and *fox*. The `AND` operator is the default operator, so `text:(quick fox)` is equivalent.
- `text:(quick OR brown)`: Returns records that contain either the word *quick* or *brown*.
- `text:(quick AND fox AND NOT news)`: Returns records that contain the words *quick* and *fox*, **and do not** contain *news*.
- `metadata.split:train AND text:fox`: Returns records that contain the word *fox* and that have a metadata *"split: train"*.
- `NOT _exists_:metadata.split` : Returns records that don't have a metadata *split*.

### Query string features

The query string syntax has many powerful features that you can use to create complex searches.
The following is just a hand-selected subset of the many features you can look up on the official [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/query-dsl-query-string-query.html).

#### Wildcards

Wildcard searches can be run on individual search terms, using `?` to replace a single character, and `*` to replace zero or more characters:

- `text:(qu?ck bro*)`
- `text.exact:"Lazy Dog*"`: Matches, for example, *"Lazy Dog"*, *"Lazy Dog."*, or *"Lazy Dogs"*.
- `inputs.\*:news`: Searches all input fields for the word *news*.

#### Regular expressions

Regular expression patterns can be embedded in the query string by wrapping them in forward slashes "/":

- `text:/joh?n(ath[oa]n)/`: Matches *jonathon*, *jonathan*, *johnathon*, and *johnathan*.

The supported regular expression syntax is explained in the official [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/regexp-syntax.html).

#### Fuzziness

You can search for terms that are similar to, but not exactly like the search terms, using the *fuzzy* operator.
This is useful to cover human misspellings:

- `text:quikc~`: Matches quick and quikc.

#### Ranges

Ranges can be specified for date, numeric or string fields.
Inclusive ranges are specified with square brackets and exclusive ranges with curly brackets:

- `score:[0.5 TO 0.6]`
- `score:{0.9 TO *}`

##### Datetime Ranges

Datetime ranges are a special kind of range query that can be defined for the `event_timestamp` and `last_updated` fields.
The formatting is similar to normal range queries, but they require an iso-formatted datetime, which can be obtained via `datetime.now().isoformat()`, resulting in `1984-01-01T01:01:01.000000`. Note that the `*` can be used interchangeably for the end of time or beginning of time.

- `event_timestamp:[1984-01-01T01:01:01.000000 TO *]`
- `last_updated:{* TO 1984-01-01T01:01:01.000000}`

#### Escaping special characters

The query string syntax has some reserved characters that you need to escape if you want to search for them.
The reserved characters are: `+ - = && || > < ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \ /`
For instance, to search for *"(1+1)=2"* you need to write:

- `text:\(1\+1\)\=2`

### Field glossary

This is a table with available fields that you can use in your query string:

| Field name                               | Description                           | TextClass.                                  | TokenClass.                                 | TextGen.                                    |
