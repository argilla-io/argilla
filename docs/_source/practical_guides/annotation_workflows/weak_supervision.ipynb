    "### Argilla weak supervision in a nutshell\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended workflow for weak supervision is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Log an unlabeled dataset into Argilla.\n",
    "- Use the `Annotate` mode for hand- and/or bulk-labeling a validation set. This validation is key to measuring the quality and performance of your rules. Additionally, you need to build a test set that is not used for defining rules. This test set will be used to measure the performance of your end model, as with any other supervised model.\n",
    "- Use the `Define rules` mode for evaluating and defining rules. Rules are defined with search queries (using ES query string DSL). Additionally, you can use the Python client methods to add, delete, or modify rules programmatically, making them available for refinement in the UI.\n",
    "- Use the Python client for reading rules, defining additional rules if needed, and training a label (for building a training set) or a downstream model (for building an end classifier).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from argilla.labeling.text_classification import Rule, WeakLabels\n",
    "\n",
    "rules = [\n",
    "    Rule(query=\"plz OR please\", label=\"SPAM\"),\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "weak_labels = WeakLabels(\n",
    "    rules=rules,\n",
    "    dataset=\"weak_supervision_yt\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# returns a summary of the applied rules\n",
    "weak_labels.summary()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The next sections cover the main components of this workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weak labeling using the UI\n",
    "\n",
    "Since version 0.8.0 you can find and define weak labeling rules directly in the UI. \n",
    "The [weak labeling mode](../../reference/webapp/pages.md#modes) to define rules is found in the right sidebar of the [Dataset page](../../reference/webapp/pages.md#dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weak supervision from Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing weak supervision with Argilla is straightforward. Keeping the same spirit as other parts of the library, you can use any weak supervision library or method, such as Snorkel or Flyingsquid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Argilla weak supervision support is built around two basic abstractions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Rule`\n",
    "A rule encodes a heuristic for labeling a record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heuristics can be defined using [Elasticsearch's queries](../../reference/webapp/features.md#search-records):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plz = Rule(query=\"plz OR please\", label=\"SPAM\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or with Python functions (similar to Snorkel's labeling functions, which you can use as well):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import Optional\n",
    "\n",
    "def contains_http(record: rg.TextClassificationRecord) -> Optional[str]:\n",
    "    if \"http\" in record.inputs[\"text\"]:\n",
    "        return \"SPAM\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides textual features, Python labeling functions can exploit metadata features:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def author_channel(record: rg.TextClassificationRecord) -> Optional[str]:\n",
    "    # the word channel appears in the comment author name\n",
    "    if \"channel\" in record.metadata[\"author\"]:\n",
    "        return \"SPAM\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A rule should either return a string value representing a weak label or `None` in case of abstention.\n",
    "\n",
    "These rules can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Defined using the no-code feature of the UI (see the [weak labeling mode](../../reference/webapp/pages.md#modes) reference).\n",
    "2. `Rule` objects can be created using Python as shown above. These objects can be either applied locally by developers (which might be interesting for testing without overloading the server) or added to the dataset in the Argilla server, making these rules available from the UI. \n",
    "3. Python functions cannot be defined with the no-code feature and can only be applied locally but not added to the dataset in the Argilla server. Data teams can use these Python labeling functions to add extra heuristics before building a weakly labeled dataset. This function should be used for heuristics which are not possible to define using ES queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Weak Labels`\n",
    "\n",
    "Weak Labels objects bundle and apply a set of rules to the records of a Argilla dataset. Applying a rule to a record means assigning a weak label or abstaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "This abstraction provides you with the building blocks for training and testing weak supervision \"denoising\", \"label\" or even \"end\" models:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "rules = [contains_http, author_channel]\n",
    "weak_labels = WeakLabels(\n",
    "    rules=rules, \n",
    "    dataset=\"weak_supervision_yt\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# returns a summary of the applied rules\n",
    "weak_labels.summary()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More information about these abstractions can be found in the [Python Labeling module docs](../../reference/python/python_labeling.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in label models\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things even easier for you, we provide wrapper classes around the most common label models, that directly consume a `WeakLabels` object.\n",
    "This makes working with those models a breeze.\n",
    "Take a look at the list of built-in models in the [labeling module docs](../../reference/python/python_labeling.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical workflow to use weak supervision is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an Argilla dataset with your raw dataset. If you actually have some labeled data you can log it into the same dataset.\n",
    "2. Define a set of weak labeling rules with the Rules definition mode in the UI or using the Python client `add_rules` method.\n",
    "3. Create a `WeakLabels` object and apply the rules using the Python client. You can load the rules from your dataset and add additional rules and labeling functions using Python. Typically, you'll iterate between this step and step 2.\n",
    "4. Once you are satisfied with your weak labels, use the matrix of the `WeakLabels` instance with your library/method of choice to build a training set or even train a downstream text classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide shows you an end-to-end example using Snorkel, Flyingsquid and Weasel. Let's get started!"

After this step, you can train a downstream model with the \"clean\" labels.\n",
