# 🌊 Simplify annotation with machine feedback workflows

Besides direct manual annotation, we also support a few annotation workflows that can be used to smoothen the annotation for your records. These workflows are: active learning, weak supervision, semantic search and job scheduling.

```{grid-item-card} 🧑‍🏫 Active Learning
:link: active_learning.html

A human-in-the-loop framework for iteratively building training sets and models.
```
```{grid-item-card} 👮 Weak Supervision
:link: weak_supervision.html

An approach to machine learning in which high-level rules and queries are used to label training data.
```
```{grid-item-card} 🔦 Semantic Search
:link: semantic_search.html

Find similar and dissimilar records in your dataset by using semantic vectors.
```
```{grid-item-card} ⏲️ Job Scheduling and Callbacks
:link: job_scheduling.html

Schedule jobs to run at a specific time or periodically.
```
```{grid-item-card} 📇 Text Descriptives as Metadata
:link: add_text_descriptives_as_metadata.html

Add text descriptives to your metadata to simplify the data annotation and filtering process.
