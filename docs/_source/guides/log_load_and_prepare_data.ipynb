    "This guide showcases some features of the `Dataset` classes in the Argilla client.\n",
    "The Dataset classes are lightweight containers for Argilla records. These classes facilitate importing from and exporting to different formats (e.g., `pandas.DataFrame`, `datasets.Dataset`) as well as sharing and versioning Argilla datasets using the Hugging Face Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each record type there's a corresponding Dataset class called `DatasetFor<RecordType>`.\n",

    "## Argilla Records\n",
    "\n",
    "The main component of the Argilla data model is called a record. A dataset in Argilla is a collection of these records. \n",
    "Records can be of different types depending on the currently supported tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. `TextClassificationRecord`\n",
    " 2. `TokenClassificationRecord`\n",
    " 3. `Text2TextRecord`\n",
    " \n",
    "The most critical attributes of a record that are common to all types are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `text`: The input text of the record (Required);\n",
    " - `annotation`: Annotate your record in a task-specific manner (Optional);\n",
    " - `prediction`: Add task-specific model predictions to the record (Optional);\n",
    " - `metadata`: Add some arbitrary metadata to the record (Optional);\n",
    " \n",
    "Some other cool attributes for a record are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `vectors`: Input vectors to enable [semantic search](label_records_with_semanticsearch.html). \n",
    " - `explanation`: Token attributions for [highlighting text](log_model_explanations.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Argilla, records are created programmatically using the [client library](../reference/python/python_client.rst) within a Python script, a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/), or another IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to create and upload a basic record to the Argilla web app  (make sure Argilla is already installed on your machine as described in the [setup guide](../getting_started/installation/installation.md)):\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create records\n",
    "\n",
    "*TextClassificationRecord*\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import argilla as rg\n",
    "\n",
    "record = rg.TextClassificationRecord(\n",
    "    text=\"Hello world, this is me!\",\n",
    "    prediction=[(\"LABEL1\", 0.8), (\"LABEL2\", 0.2)],\n",
    "    annotation=\"LABEL1\",\n",
    "    multi_label=False,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*TextClassificationRecord*\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import argilla as rg\n",
    "\n",
    "record = rg.TokenClassificationRecord(\n",
    "    text=\"Michael is a professor at Harvard\",\n",
    "    tokens=[\"Michael\", \"is\", \"a\", \"professor\", \"at\", \"Harvard\"],\n",
    "    prediction=[(\"NAME\", 0, 7), (\"LOC\", 26, 33)],\n",

    "    prediction=[\"Je m'appelle Sarah et j'aime mon chien.\"],\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Metadata Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate some customization for the usage of metadata fields, we also added some custom metadata fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Protected fields\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding a leading underscore `_` to a random metadata field, we can refrain Argilla from indexing it, which allows us to store the additional info in Elastic without performance loss. So, these metadata fields won't be used in queries or filters by adding an underscore at the start e.g. `_my_field`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Image support\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pass a URL in the metadata field `_image_url` and the image will be rendered in the Argilla UI. You can use this in the Text Classification and the Token Classification tasks. These images need to be hosted on a publicly available URL, or private file servers like NGINX, or Minio."

    " \n",
    "Under the hood the Dataset classes store the records in a simple Python list. Therefore, working with a Dataset class is not very different from working with a simple list of records, but before creating a dataset we should first define dataset settings and a labeling schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Argilla datasets have certain *settings* that you can configure via the `rg.*Settings` classes, for example `rg.TextClassificationSettings`. The Dataset classes do some extra checks for you, to make sure you do not mix record types when appending or indexing into a dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Define a labeling schema\n",
    "You can define a labeling schema for your Argilla dataset, which fixes the allowed labels for your predictions and annotations.\n",
    "Once you set a labeling schema, each time you log to the corresponding dataset, Argilla will perform validations of the added predictions and annotations to make sure they comply with the schema.\n",
    "You can set your labels using the code below or from the [Dataset settings page](../reference/webapp/pages.md#dataset-settings) in the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you forget to define a labeling schema, Argilla will aggregate the labels it finds in the dataset automatically, but you will need to validate it. To do this, go to your [Dataset settings page](../reference/webapp/pages.md#dataset-settings) and click _Save schema_.\n",

    "### Using `rg.monitor`\n",
    "\n",
    "For widely-used libraries Argilla includes an \"auto-monitoring\" option via the `rg.monitor` method. Currently supported libraries are Hugging Face Transformers and spaCy, if you'd like to see another library supported feel free to add a discussion or issue on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "`rg.monitor` will wrap HF and spaCy pipelines so every time you call them, the output of these calls will be logged into the dataset of your choice, as a background process, in a non-blocking way. Additionally, `rg.monitor` will add several tags to your dataset such as the library build version, the model name, the language, etc. This should also work for custom (private) pipelines, not only the Hub's or official spaCy models.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that this feature is useful beyond monitoring, and can be used for data collection (e.g., bootstrapping data annotation with pre-trained pipelines), model development (e.g., error analysis), and model evaluation (e.g., combined with data annotation to obtain evaluation metrics)."
