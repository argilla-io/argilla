    "It is good practice to use at least the dataset guidelines, if not both methods. In the guidelines, you can include a description of the project, details on how to answer each question with examples, instructions on when to discard a record, etc. Question descriptions should be short and provide context to a specific question. They can be a summary of the guidelines to that question, but often times that is not sufficient to align the whole annotation team."
