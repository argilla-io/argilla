# Monitoring LangChain apps

This guide explains how to use the `ArgillaCallbackHandler` to integrate Argilla with LangChain apps. With this integration, Argilla can be used evaluate and fine-tune LLMs. It works by collecting the interactions with LLMs and pushing them into a `FeedbackDataset` for continuous monitoring and human feedback. You just need to create a Langchain-compatible `FeedbackDataset` in Argilla and then instantiate the `ArgillaCallbackHandler` to be provided to `LangChain` LLMs, Chains, and/or Agents.

:::{warning}
As of Argilla 1.14.0 the `FeedbackDataset` has been refactored to improve its usage, so if you're using Argilla 1.14.0 or higher, you won't be able to use the `ArgillaCallbackHandler` as it's not been updated in `LangChain` yet.

## How to create a `LangChain`-compatible `FeedbackDataset`

Due to the way `LangChain` callbacks and `FeedbackDataset`s work, we need to create a `FeedbackDataset` in Argilla with a certain structure for the fields, while the questions and the guidelines remain open and can be defined by the user.

The `FeedbackDataset` needs to have the following fields: `prompt` and `response`; the `prompt` field is the one that will be used to provide the input to the LLMs, while the `response` field is the one that will be used to collect the output of the LLMs.

Then, regarding the questions and the guidelines, the user is free to define them as they wish, as they will not be used by the `ArgillaCallbackHandler` to collect the data generated by the LLMs, but they will be used to annotate the `FeedbackDataset`.

Here's an example of how to create a `FeedbackDataset` in Argilla that can be used with `ArgillaCallbackHandler`:

```python
import argilla as rg

rg.init(
    api_url="...",
    api_key="..."
)

dataset = rg.FeedbackDataset(
    fields=[
        rg.TextField(name="prompt", required=True),
        rg.TextField(name="response", required=True)
    ],
    questions=[
        rg.RatingQuestion(
            name="response-rating",
            description="How would you rate the quality of the response?",
            values=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
            required=True,
        ),
        rg.TextQuestion(
            name="response-correction",
            description="If you think the response is not accurate, please, correct it.",
            required=False,
        ),
    ],
    guidelines="Please, read the questions carefully and try to answer it as accurately as possible.",
)
```

Then you'll need to push that `FeedbackDataset` to Argilla as follows, otherwise, the `ArgillaCallbackHandler` won't work.

```python
dataset.push_to_argilla("langchain-dataset")
```

For more information on how to create a `FeedbackDataset`, please refer to the [Create a Feedback Dataset](create_dataset.md) guide.

## How to use `ArgillaCallbackHandler`

As all the `LangChain` callbacks, those are instantiated and provided to the `LangChain` LLMs, Chains, and/or Agents, and then there's no need to worry about them anymore, as those will automatically keep track of everything taking place in the `LangChain` pipeline. In this case, we're keeping track of both the input and the final response provided by the LLMs, Chains, and/or Agents.

```python
from langchain.callbacks import ArgillaCallbackHandler

argilla_callback = ArgillaCallbackHandler(
    dataset_name="langchain-dataset",
    api_url="...",
    api_key="...",
)
```

### Scenario 1: Tracking an LLM

First, let's just run a single LLM a few times and capture the resulting prompt-response pairs in Argilla.

```python
from langchain.callbacks import ArgillaCallbackHandler, StdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

argilla_callback = ArgillaCallbackHandler(
    dataset_name="langchain-dataset",
    api_url="...",
    api_key="...",
)

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9, callbacks=[argilla_callback])
llm.generate(["Tell me a joke", "Tell me a poem"] * 3)
```

### Scenario 2: Tracking an LLM in a chain

Then we can create a chain using a prompt template, and then track the initial prompt and the final response in Argilla.

```python
from langchain.callbacks import ArgillaCallbackHandler, StdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

argilla_callback = ArgillaCallbackHandler(
    dataset_name="langchain-dataset",
    api_url="...",
    api_key="...",
)

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9, callbacks=[argilla_callback])

template = """You are a playwright. Given the title of play, it is your job to write a synopsis for that title.
Title: {title}
Playwright: This is a synopsis for the above play:"""
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["title"], template=template)
synopsis_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template, callbacks=[argilla_callback])

test_prompts = [{"title": "Documentary about Bigfoot in Paris"}]
synopsis_chain.apply(test_prompts)
```

### Scenario 3: Using an Agent with Tools

Finally, as a more advanced workflow, you can create an agent that uses some tools. So that `ArgillaCallbackHandler` will keep track of the input and the output, but not about the intermediate steps/thoughts, so that given a prompt we log the original prompt and the final response to that given prompt.

> Note that for this scenario we'll be using Google Search API (Serp API) so you will need to both install `google-search-results` as `pip install google-search-results`, and to set the Serp API Key as `os.environ["SERPAPI_API_KEY"] = "..."` (you can find it at https://serpapi.com/dashboard), otherwise the example below won't work.

```python
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools
from langchain.callbacks import ArgillaCallbackHandler, StdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

argilla_callback = ArgillaCallbackHandler(
    dataset_name="langchain-dataset",
    api_url="...",
    api_key="...",
)

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9, callbacks=[argilla_callback])
tools = load_tools(["serpapi"], llm=llm, callbacks=[argilla_callback])
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    callbacks=[argilla_callback],
)
agent.run("Who was the first president of the United States of America?")
```
