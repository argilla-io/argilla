    "# Annotate a Feedback Dataset\n",

    "![Spanshot of the Submitted queue and the progress bar in a Feedback dataset](../../../_static/images/llms/snapshot-feedback-submitted.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you open the dataset in the UI, you will see by default the records with `Pending` responses, i.e. records that still don't have a response, in a single-record view. On the left, you can find the record to annotate and on the right the form with all the questions to answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "We highly recommend that you read the annotation guidelines before starting the annotation. If there are any, you can find them in the dataset settings page. To get there, you can click on the settings icon in the right side of the top bar or click the link to the annotation guidelines at the top of the feedback form. If any of the questions have a description, you will find an info icon next to them. Click on it to read the description.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the annotation view, you will be able to provide responses. Once all required questions have responses, the `Submit` button will be enabled and you will be able to submit your response. If you prefer not to give a response for a record, you can move to the next record or discard it using the `Discard` button. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can speed up the annotation process by using these shortcuts:\n",

    "|Go to previous page|&larr; `Left arrow`|\n",
    "|Go to next page|&rarr; `Right arrow`|\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to review your submitted or discarded responses, you can select the queue you need. From there, you can modify, submit or discard responses. You can also use the `Clear` button to remove the response and send the record back to the `Pending` queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can track your progress and the number of `Pending`, `Submitted` and `Discarded` responses by clicking the `Progress` icon in the sidebar."
