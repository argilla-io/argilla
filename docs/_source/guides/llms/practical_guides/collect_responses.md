# Collect responses from an annotated Feedback Dataset

To collect the responses given by annotators via Python, you can simply load the dataset from Argilla as follows:

```python
import argilla as rg

rg.init(
    api_url="...",
    api_key="...",
)

feedback = rg.FeedbackDataset.from_argilla("demo_feedback", workspace="recognai")
```

Each record in `feedback.records` will have an attribute `responses` where you will find a list with all the responses to that record, if any. Each response will have the following attributes:

- `user_id`: contains the Argilla user ID of the annotator
- `values`: contains the responses given by the annotator in the shape of a dictinary, where the key is the name of the question and the value is another dictionary where you can find the answer to the question under the key `value`.
- `status`: contains the status of the response i.e., whether it is `submitted`, or `discarded`.


If your dataset doesn't have any annotation overlap i.e., all records have at most one response, the post-processing stage will be quite simple since you won't need to decide which annotations to keep and which to discard.

```{note}
Remember to only take into account responses with the `submitted` status.
```

## Measure disagreements

If your dataset does have records with more than one `submitted` response, you will need to unify the responses before using the data for training.

Ratings often represent a subjective value, meaning that there is no wrong or right answer for these questions. However, since a `RatingQuestion` has a closed set of options, their results can help with visualizing the disagreement between annotators. On the other hand, texts are unique and subjective, making it almost impossible that two annotators will give the same answer for a `TextQuestion`. For this reason, we don't recommend using these responses to measure disagreements.

If you want to do an initial exploration of the responses, you can use your preferred library for plotting data. Here are some simple examples of some visualisations that you could do to evaluate the potential disagreement between annotators:

```python
# plot 1: submitted responses per record
from collections import Counter, OrderedDict
import plotly.express as px

count_submitted = Counter()
for record in feedback.records:
    if record.responses:
        submitted = [r for r in record.responses if r.status == "submitted"]
        count_submitted[len(submitted)] += 1
count_submitted = OrderedDict(sorted(count_submitted.items()))
count_submitted = [{"submitted_responses": k, "no_records": v} for k, v in count_submitted.items()]


fig = px.bar(count_submitted, x="submitted_responses", y="no_records")
fig.update_xaxes(title_text="No. of submitted responses", dtick=1)
fig.update_yaxes(title_text="No. of records")
fig.show()
```

```python
# plot 2: distance between responses in rating question
list_values = []
for record_ix,record in enumerate(feedback):
    if record.responses:
        submitted = [r for r in record.responses if r.status == "submitted"]
        if len(submitted) > 1:
            for response_ix, response in enumerate(submitted):
                list_values.append({"record": str(record_ix+1), "annotator": str(response_ix+1), "value": response.values["rating"].value})


fig = px.box(list_values, x='annotator', y='value', color='annotator', points='all', hover_data='record')
fig.update_yaxes(dtick=1)
fig.show()
```

```{hint}
If you feel that the disagreement between annotators is too high, especially for questions that aren't as subjective, this is a good sign that you should review your annotation guidelines and/or the questions and options.
```

## Solve disagreements

In this section, we explore some techniques you can use to solve disagreements in the responses. These are not the only possible techniques and you should choose them carefully according to the needs of your project and annotation team.

Once you have unified your responses, you will have a dataset that's ready for [fine-tuning](fine_tune.ipynb). Remember to saved your unified dataset following one of the methods explained in [Export a Feedback dataset](export_dataset.ipynb).


### Unifying ratings
#### Majority vote
If a record has more than 2 submitted responses, you can take the most popular option as the final score. In the case of a tie, you can break it choosing a random option or the lowest / highest score.

#### Mean score
For this technique you can take all responses and calculate the mean score. That will be final rating.

#### Lowest / highest score
Depending on how the question is formulated, you can take the `max` or `min` value. That will be the final rating.

### Unifying texts
#### Rate / rank the responses
Make a new dataset that includes the texts you have collected in the record fields and ask your annotation team to rate or rank the responses. Then choose the response with the highest score. If there is a tie, choose one of the options randomly or consider duplicating the record as explained [below](#duplicate-the-record).

#### Choose based on the annotator
Take a subset of the records (enough to get a good representation of responses from each annotator), and rate / rank them as explained in the section above. Then, give each annotator a score based on the preferences of the team. You can use this score to choose text responses over the whole dataset.

#### Choose based on answers to other questions
You can use the answers to other questions as quality markers. For example, you can assume that whoever gave the lowest score will make a more extensive correction and you may want to choose that as the final text. However, this method does not guarantee that the text will be of good quality.

#### Duplicate the record
You may consider that the different answers given by your annotation team are all valid options. In this case, you can duplicate the record to keep each answer. Again, this method does not guarantee the quality of the text, so it is recommended to check the quality of the text, for example using a rating question.
