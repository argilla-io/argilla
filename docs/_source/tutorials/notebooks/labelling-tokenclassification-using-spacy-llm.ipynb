    "\n",
    "- Run Argilla and load `spacy-llm` along with other libraries\n",
    "- Define few-shot examples for the model\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "NER is a Natural Language Processing task where tokens are categorized into pre-defined categories such as person, organization or place as `named entities`. Thus, NER is one of the primary steps to turn unstructured data into structured data. With Argilla, you will have the opportunity to validate and annotate the named entities that you obtain from your NER pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "[spacy-llm](https://spacy.io/usage/large-language-models) is a package that integrates the strength of LLMs into regular spaCy pipelines, thus allowing quick and practical prompting for various tasks. Besides, since it requires no training data, the models are ready to use in your pipeline. If you want to train your own model or create your custom task, `spacy-llm` also helps to implement any custom pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will create a `spacy-llm` pipeline to perform NER on `banking77` dataset. It is a dataset consisting of online banking queries by customers and their annotations with the corresponding intents. We will show our model a few positive and negative examples to improve its performance, where we will actually have defined a category for a specific named entity."
