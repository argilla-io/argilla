    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "NER is a Natural Language Processing task where tokens are categorized into pre-defined categories such as person, organization or place as `named entities`. Thus, NER is one of the primary steps to turn the unstructured data into structured data. With Argilla, you will have the opportunity to validate and annotate the named entities that you obtain from your NER pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "[spacy-llm](https://spacy.io/usage/large-language-models) is a package that integrates the strength of LLMs into regular spaCy pipelines, thus allowing to quick and practical prompting for various tasks. Besides, since it requires no training data, the models are ready to use in your pipeline. If you want to train your own model or create your custom task, `spacy-llm` also helps to implement any custom pipeline.\\n\","

    "For details about configuring your deployment, check the [official Hugging Face Hub guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-argilla).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image**: This is the recommended option if you want [Argilla running on your local machine](../../getting_started/quickstart.ipynb). Note that this option will only let you run the tutorial locally and not with an external notebook service.\n",

    "- Use the Open in Colab button at the top of this page. This option allows you to run the notebook directly on Google Colab. Don't forget to change the runtime type to GPU for faster model training and inference.\n",
