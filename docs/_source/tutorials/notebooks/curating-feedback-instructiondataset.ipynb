    "In this tutorial, we will show you how you can curate a public instruction dataset, like [Databricks' Dolly](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k), to use it for fine-tuning an LLM to solve instruction tasks. It will walk you through the following steps:\n",

    "## Running Argilla\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, you will need to have an Argilla server running. There are two main options for deploying and running Argilla:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Deploy Argilla on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-argilla): This is the fastest option and the recommended choice for connecting to external notebooks (e.g., Google Colab) if you have an account on Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image](../../getting_started/quickstart.ipynb): This is the recommended option if you want Argilla running on your local machine. Note that this option will only let you run the tutorial locally and not with an external notebook service.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on deployment options, please check the Deployment section of the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",

    "Tip\n",
    "    \n",
    "This tutorial is a Jupyter Notebook. There are two options to run it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the Open in Colab button at the top of this page. This option allows you to run the notebook directly on Google Colab. Don't forget to change the runtime type to GPU for faster model training and inference.\n",
    "- Download the .ipynb file by clicking on the View source link at the top of the page. This option allows you to download the notebook and run it on your local machine or on a Jupyter notebook tool of your choice.\n",
