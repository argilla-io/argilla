    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll use the power of embeddings to make data labeling (and curation) more efficient. The idea of exploiting embeddings for labeling is not new, and there are several cool, standalone libraries to label data using embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `1.2.0`, Argilla gives you a way to leverage embedding-based similarity together with all other workflows already provided: search-based bulk labeling, programmatic labeling using search queries, model pre-annotation, and human-in-the-loop workflows. This also means you can combine keyword search and filters with this new similarity search feature. All these without any vendor or model lock-in, you can use ANY embedding or encoding method, including but not limited to `Sentence Transformers`, `OpenAI`, or `Co:here`. If you want a deep-dive, you can check the [Semantic similarity deep-dive](../../guides/features/semantic-search.ipynb), but this tutorial will show you the basics to get started. \n",

    "\n",
    "For details about configuring your deployment, check the [official Hugging Face Hub guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-argilla).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image**: This is the recommended option if you want [Argilla running on your local machine](../../getting_started/quickstart.ipynb). Note that this option will only let you run the tutorial locally and not with an external notebook service.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Label a record (e.g., \"Change my information\" with the label `change_details`) and then click on Find similar on the top-right of your record.\n",
    "2. As a result, you'll get to a list of the most similar record sorted by similarity (on descending order).\n",

    "![labeling-textclassification-sentence-transformers-semantic](../../_static/tutorials/labelling-textclassification-sentence-transformers-semantic/4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see the model is effectively capturing similar meaning without the need of explicit shared words: e.g., `details` vs `information`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review records\n",
    "At this point, you can label the records one by one or scroll-down to review them before using the bulk-labeling button on the top of the records list.\n",
