Alternatively, you can take a look at our [Elasticsearch docs](../../getting_started/installation/elasticsearch.md) about creating retention snapshots directly from your Elasticsearch cluster. It will walk you through the following steps:\n",

    "It is important to be able to keep track and store data to version data used in training cycles and to avoid losing data. DVC creates a reference to your data and stores it within an external storage repo. Pushing this reference to get allows us to reproduce certain stages of your repository, while also having a copy of the exact data that was in the repo during that exact time. Think \"git for data\".\n",

    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, you will need to have an Argilla server running. There are two main options for deploying and running Argilla:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Deploy Argilla on Hugging Face Spaces](../../getting_started/installation/deployments/huggingface-spaces.html): This is the fastest option and the recommended choice for connecting to external notebooks (e.g., Google Colab) if you have an account on Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image](../../getting_started/quickstart.ipynb): This is the recommended option if you want Argilla running on your local machine. Note that this option will only let you run the tutorial locally and not with an external notebook service.\n",
