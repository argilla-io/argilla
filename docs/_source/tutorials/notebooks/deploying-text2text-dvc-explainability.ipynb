    "It is important to be able to keep track and store data to version data used in training cycles and to avoid losing data. DVC creates a reference to your data and stores it within an external storage repo. Pushing this reference to get allows us to reproduce certain stages of your repository, while also having a copy of the exact data that was in the repo during that exact time. Think \"git for data\".\n",
