    "> Active learning is a special case of machine learning in which a learning algorithm can interactively query a user (or some other information source) to label new data points with the desired outputs. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning))\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised machine learning often requires large amounts of labeled data that are expensive to generate. \n",
    "*Active Learning* (AL) systems attempt to overcome this labeling bottleneck. \n",
    "The underlying idea is that not all data points are equally important for training the model. \n",
    "The AL system tries to query only the most relevant data from a pool of unlabeled data to be labeled by a so-called *oracle*, which is often a human annotator.\n",
    "Therefore, AL systems are usually much more sample efficient and need far less training data than traditional supervised systems.\n",

    "This tutorial will show you how to incorporate [Argilla](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla) into an active learning workflow involving a human in the loop.\n",

    "Hugging Face's [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) will provide the classifier we will embed in an active learner from small-text. Argilla excels in making **you** the oracle that conveniently teaches the model via an intuitive UI."

    "\n",
    "**Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image**: This is the recommended option if you want [Argilla running on your local machine](../../getting_started/quickstart.ipynb).
