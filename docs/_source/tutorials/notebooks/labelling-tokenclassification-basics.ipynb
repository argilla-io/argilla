    "\n",
    "Annotations are often done by teams that share the workload. When this is the case, we want to avoid annotation overlap for efficiency or to control when and how this overlap happens. To do this in Argilla `(v1.6.0)` we have two options: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. we can keep a single dataset and assign a set of records to each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. we can split our dataset into different datasets that have the records assigned to each user and log them in their personal workspaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to use option 1 if you want to keep the whole dataset available to see and explore for every team member but still, you want them to focus on a set of records when they annotate. This can be interesting if your annotators also make weak labeling rules based on the annotations of the whole team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 2 is better if you want each team member to work independently and not see the records that other teammates are working on. This can be interesting if you want to measure annotator agreement afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will make a random assignment where each record is annotated by one person only and walk you through sharing your assignments with your team using each option. \n",

    "For details about configuring your deployment, check the [official Hugging Face Hub guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-argilla).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image**: This is the recommended option if you want [Argilla running on your local machine](../../getting_started/quickstart.ipynb).
