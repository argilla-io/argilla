    "According to [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/part-10-step-by-step-guide-to-master-nlp-named-entity-recognition/), \n",
    "\"NER is a **natural language processing technique** that can automatically scan entire articles and pull out some fundamental entities in a text and classify them into predefined categories\". These entities can be names, quantities, dates and times, amounts of money/currencies, and much more. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair) is a library which facilitates the application of NLP models to NER and other NLP techniques in many different languages. It is not only a powerful library, but also intuitive. \n",

    "Thanks to these resources and the [*Annotation Mode*](../../reference/webapp/features.html#annotate) of *Argilla*, we can quickly build up a data set to train a domain-specific model."

    "**Deploy Argilla on Hugging Face Spaces**: If you want to run tutorials with external notebooks (e.g., Google Colab) and you have an account on Hugging Face, you can deploy Argilla on Spaces with a few clicks:\n",

    "For details about configuring your deployment, check the [official Hugging Face Hub guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-argilla).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image**: This is the recommended option if you want [Argilla running on your local machine](../../getting_started/quickstart.ipynb). Note that this option will only let you run the tutorial locally and not with an external notebook service.\n",

    "- Use the Open in Colab button at the top of this page. This option allows you to run the notebook directly on Google Colab. Don't forget to change the runtime type to GPU for faster model training and inference.\n",
