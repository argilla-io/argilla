    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Weak supervision is a branch of machine learning where noisy, limited, or imprecise sources are used to provide supervision signal for labeling large amounts of training data in a supervised learning setting. This approach alleviates the burden of obtaining hand-labeled data sets, which can be costly or impractical. Instead, inexpensive weak labels are employed with the understanding that they are imperfect, but can nonetheless be used to create a strong predictive model.* [[Wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_supervision)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a broader introduction to weak supervision, as well as further references, we recommend the excellent [overview by Alex Ratner et al.](https://www.snorkel.org/blog/weak-supervision).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to be a practical introduction to weak supervision and will walk you through its entire process.\n",
    "First we will generate weak labels with *Argilla*, combine these labels with *Snorkel*, and finally train a classifier with *Scikit Learn*."

    "For details about configuring your deployment, check the [official Hugging Face Hub guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-argilla).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image**: This is the recommended option if you want [Argilla running on your local machine](../../getting_started/quickstart.ipynb). Note that this option will only let you run the tutorial locally and not with an external notebook service.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we saw how you can leverage weak supervision to quickly build up a large training data set, and use it for the training of a first lightweight model.\n",

    "*Argilla* is a very handy tool to start the weak supervision process by making it easy to find a good set of starting rules, and to reiterate on them dynamically.\n",
    "Since *Argilla* also provides built-in support for the most common label models, you can get from rules to weak labels in a few straight forward steps.\n",
    "For more suggestions on how to leverage weak labels, you can checkout our [weak supervision guide](../../guides/techniques/weak_supervision.html) where we describe an [interesting approach](../../guides/techniques/weak_supervision.html#Joint-Model-with-Weasel) to jointly train the label and a transformers downstream model."
