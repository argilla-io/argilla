    "- 🔧 The test set is used for evaluating our weak labels, label model and downstream news classifier.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Weak supervision is a branch of machine learning where noisy, limited, or imprecise sources are used to provide supervision signals for labeling large amounts of training data in a supervised learning setting. This approach alleviates the burden of obtaining hand-labeled data sets, which can be costly or impractical. Instead, inexpensive weak labels are employed with the understanding that they are imperfect, but can nonetheless be used to create a strong predictive model.* [[Wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_supervision)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a broader introduction to weak supervision, as well as further references, we recommend the excellent [overview by Alex Ratner et al.](https://www.snorkel.org/blog/weak-supervision).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to be a practical introduction to weak supervision and will walk you through its entire process.\n",
    "First, we will generate weak labels with *Argilla*, combine these labels with *Snorkel*, and finally train a classifier with *Scikit Learn*."

    "\n",
    "**Deploy Argilla on Hugging Face Spaces**: If you want to run tutorials with external notebooks (e.g., Google Colab) and you have an account on Hugging Face, you can deploy Argilla on Spaces with a few clicks:\n",

    "For details about configuring your deployment, check the [official Hugging Face Hub guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-argilla).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image**: This is the recommended option if you want [Argilla running on your local machine](../../getting_started/quickstart.ipynb). Note that this option will only let you run the tutorial locally and not with an external notebook service.\n",

    "## 3. Denoise weak labels with Snorkel's Label Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal at this step is to **denoise** the weak labels we've just created using rules. There are several approaches to this problem using different statistical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we're going to use Snorkel but you can actually use any other Label model or weak supervision method, such as FlyingSquid for example (see the [Weak supervision guide](../../practical_guides/annotation_workflows/weak_supervision.ipynb) for more details).\n",
    "For convenience, Argilla defines a simple wrapper over Snorkel's Label Model so it's easier to use with Argilla weak labels and datasets\n",

    "Let's first read the rules defined in our dataset and create our weak labels:"

    "*Argilla* is a very handy tool to start the weak supervision process by making it easy to find a good set of starting rules and to reiterate them dynamically.\n",
