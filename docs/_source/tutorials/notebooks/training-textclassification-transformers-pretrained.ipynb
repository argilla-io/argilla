    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is one of the most subjective tasks in NLP. What we understand by sentiment will vary from one application to another and depend on the business objectives of the project. Also, sentiment can be modeled in different ways, leading to different **labeling schemes**. For example, sentiment can be modeled as real value (going from -1 to 1, from 0 to 1.0, etc.) or with 2 or more labels (including different degrees such as positive, negative, neutral, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we'll use the **original labeling scheme** defined by the pre-trained model which is composed of two labels: `POSITIVE` and `NEGATIVE`. We could have added the `NEUTRAL` label, but let's keep it simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important issue when approaching a data annotation project is the **annotation guidelines**, which explain how to assign the labels to specific examples. As we'll see later, the messages we'll be labeling are mostly questions with a neutral sentiment, which we'll label with the `POSITIVE` label, and some others are negative questions which we'll label with the `NEGATIVE` label. Later on, we'll show some examples of each label.\n",
