    "For details about configuring your deployment, check the [official Hugging Face Hub guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-argilla).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image**: This is the recommended option if you want [Argilla running on your local machine](../../getting_started/quickstart.ipynb). Note that this option will only let you run the tutorial locally and not with an external notebook service.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we saw how you can use *Argilla* to tackle multi-label text classification problems with weak supervision.\n",
    "We showed you how to train two downstream models on two different multi-label datasets using the discovered heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the emotion classification task, we trained a full-blown transformer model with Hugging Face, while for the topic classification task, we relied on a more lightweight Bayes classifier from sklearn.\n",
    "Although the results are not perfect, they can serve as a good baseline for future improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the next time you encounter a multi-label classification problem, maybe try out weak supervision with *Argilla* and save some time for your annotation team 😀."
