    "# 🧸 Using LLMs for Text Classification and Summarization Suggestions with `spacy-llm`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll implement a `spacy-llm` pipeline to obtain model suggestions with GPT3.5 and add them to our `FeedbackDataset` as `suggestions`. The flow of the tutorial will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run Argilla and load `spacy-llm` along with other libraries\n",
    "- Define config for your pipeline and initialize it\n",
    "- Create your `FeedbackDataset` instance\n",
    "- Generate predictions on data and add them to `records`\n",
    "- Push to Argilla\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[spacy-llm](https://spacy.io/usage/large-language-models) is a package that integrates the strength of LLMs into regular spaCy pipelines, thus allowing quick and practical prompting for various tasks. Besides, since it requires no training data, the models are ready to use in your pipeline. If you want to train your own model or create your custom task, `spacy-llm` also helps to implement any custom pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite easy to use this powerful package with Argilla Feedback datasets. We can make inferences with the pipeline we will create and add them to our `FeedbackDataset`."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deploy Argilla on Hugging Face Spaces**: If you want to run tutorials with external notebooks (e.g., Google Colab) and you have an account on Hugging Face, you can deploy Argilla on Spaces with a few clicks:\n",
    "\n",
    "[![deploy on spaces](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/raw/main/deploy-to-spaces-lg.svg)](https://huggingface.co/new-space?template=argilla/argilla-template-space)\n",
    "\n",
    "For details about configuring your deployment, check the [official Hugging Face Hub guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-argilla).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image**: This is the recommended option if you want [Argilla running on your local machine](../../getting_started/quickstart.md). Note that this option will only let you run the tutorial locally and not with an external notebook service.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on deployment options, please check the Deployment section of the documentation.\n",

    "Tip\n",
    "    \n",
    "This tutorial is a Jupyter Notebook. There are two options to run it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the Open in Colab button at the top of this page. This option allows you to run the notebook directly on Google Colab. Don't forget to change the runtime type to GPU for faster model training and inference.\n",
    "- Download the .ipynb file by clicking on the View source link at the top of the page. This option allows you to download the notebook and run it on your local machine or on a Jupyter notebook tool of your choice.\n",
