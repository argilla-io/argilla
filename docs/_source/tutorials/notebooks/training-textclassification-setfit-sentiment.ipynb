    "# 🤗 Train a sentiment classifier with SetFit\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll **build a sentiment classifier for user requests in the banking domain** using SetFit and Argilla.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SetFit** is an exciting open-source package for few-shot classification developed by teams at Hugging Face and Intel Labs. You can read all about it on the [project repository](https://github.com/huggingface/setfit). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Argilla** empowers you to quickly build and iterate on training data for NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to combine them to build a sentiment classifier from scratch!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show you how to fine-tune a sentiment classifier for your own domain, starting with no labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most online tutorials about fine-tuning models assume you already have a training dataset. You'll find many tutorials for fine-tuning a pre-trained model with widely used datasets, such as IMDB for sentiment analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, often **what you want is to fine-tune a model for your use case**. It's well-known that NLP model performance usually degrades with \"out-of-domain\" data. For example, a sentiment classifier pre-trained on movie reviews (e.g., IMDB) will not perform very well with customer requests.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deploy Argilla on Hugging Face Spaces**: If you want to run tutorials with external notebooks (e.g., Google Colab) and you have an account on Hugging Face, you can deploy Argilla on Spaces with a few clicks:\n",

    "[![deploy on spaces](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/raw/main/deploy-to-spaces-lg.svg)](https://huggingface.co/new-space?template=argilla/argilla-template-space)\n",
    "\n",
    "For details about configuring your deployment, check the [official Hugging Face Hub guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-argilla).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image**: This is the recommended option if you want [Argilla running on your local machine](../../getting_started/quickstart.ipynb). Note that this option will only let you run the tutorial locally and not with an external notebook service.\n",

    "- Use the Open in Colab button at the top of this page. This option allows you to run the notebook directly on Google Colab. Don't forget to change the runtime type to GPU for faster model training and inference.\n",

    "Here we are using the simplest approach for training our SetFit model. Since it [integrates with Optuna](https://github.com/huggingface/setfit/blob/main/notebooks/text-classification_hyperparameter-search.ipynb), you could use hyperparameter tuning to find the best hyperparameter for training your model. However, it is better to start with a simple baseline, validate the model for your use case and iterate on the data before focusing on model experimentation and tuning."
