    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains a simple trick you can leverage with Argilla for finding potential errors in training data: _using your model loss to identify label errors or ambiguous examples_. This trick is not new (those who've worked with fastai know how useful the `plot_top_losses` method is). Even Andrej Karpathy [tweeted](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1311884485676294151) about this some time ago:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When you sort your dataset descending by loss you are guaranteed to find something unexpected, strange and helpful.</p>&mdash; Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1311884485676294151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n",
    "<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique is really simple: if you are training a model with a training set, train your model, and apply your model to the training set to **compute the loss for each example in the training set**. If you sort your dataset examples by loss, examples with the highest loss are the most ambiguous and difficult to learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "This technique can be used for **error analysis during model development** (e.g., identifying tokenization problems), but it turns out is also a really simple technique for **cleaning up your training data, during model development or after training data collection activities**. \n",
    " \n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll use this technique with a well-known text classification benchmark, the [AG News dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ag_news). After computing the losses, we'll use Argilla to analyse the highest loss examples. In less than 5 minutes, we manually check and relabel the first 50 examples. In fact, the first 50 examples with the highest loss, are all incorrect in the original training set. If we visually inspect further examples, we still find label errors in the top 500 examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it's important\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Machine learning models are only as good as the data they're trained on**. Almost all training data sources can be considered *\"noisy\"* (e.g., crowd-workers, annotator errors, weak supervision sources, data augmentation, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. With this simple technique **we're able to find more than 50 label errors on a widely-used benchmark in less than 5 minutes** (your dataset will probably be noisier!).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. With advanced model architectures widely available, **managing, cleaning, and curating data is becoming a key step for making robust ML applications**. A good summary of the current situation can be found on the website of the [Data-centric AI NeurIPS Workshop](http://datacentricai.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This simple trick **can be used across the whole ML lifecycle** and not only for finding label errors. With this trick, you can improve data preprocessing, tokenization, and even your model architecture."

    "For details about configuring your deployment, check the [official Hugging Face Hub guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-argilla).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launch Argilla using Argilla's quickstart Docker image**: This is the recommended option if you want [Argilla running on your local machine](../../getting_started/quickstart.ipynb). Note that this option will only let you run the tutorial locally and not with an external notebook service.\n",
