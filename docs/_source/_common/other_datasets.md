```{note}
The records classes covered in this section correspond to three datasets: `DatasetForTextClassification`, `DatasetForTokenClassification`, and `DatasetForText2Text`. These will be deprecated in Argilla 2.0 and replaced by the fully configurable `FeedbackDataset` class. Not sure which dataset to use? Check out our section on [choosing a dataset](/practical_guides/choose_dataset).
