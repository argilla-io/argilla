Welcome to Argilla! Argilla is a platform to build high-quality datasets.

To get started, create your first dataset as follows.

[For in-depth user guides, check the documentation ðŸ“–.](https://docs.argilla.io/en/latest/)

**1.Open an IDE, Jupyter or Collab**

Open your favorite IDE, Jupyter or Collab. If you're a Collab user, you can directly use our [introductory tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/argilla-io/argilla/blob/develop/docs/_source/getting_started/quickstart_workflow_feedback.ipynb).

**2.Install the SDK with pip**

To upload and read datasets from Argilla, you need to use the Argilla SDK. You can install the SDK with pip as follows:

```sh
pip install argilla -U
```

**3.Connect to your Argilla server**

Get your `ARGILLA_API_URL`:

   * If you are using Docker, it is the URL shown in your browser (by default `http://localhost:6900`)
   * If you are using HF Spaces, it should be constructed as follows: `https://[your-owner-name]-[your_space_name].hf.space`

Get your `ARGILLA_API_KEY` you find in ["My settings"](/user_settings) and copy the API key.

Connect the SDK with the server using `rg.init`. Make sure to replace `ARGILLA_API_URL` and `ARGILLA_API_KEY` with the values you obtained in the previous steps. If you are using a private HF Space, you also need to specify your `HF_TOKEN` that can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

```python
import argilla as rg

rg.init(
    api_url="ARGILLA_API_URL",
    api_key="ARGILLA_API_KEY",
    # extra_headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {"HF_TOKEN"}"}
)
```

**4.Create your first dataset**

Specify a workspace where the dataset will be created. Check your workspaces in ["My settings"](/user_settings). If you want to create a new workspace, check the [docs](https://docs.argilla.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation/configurations/workspace_management.html).

Create a Dataset with two labels ("sadness" and "joy"). Don't forget to replace "<your-workspace>" with the workspace you want to use. In this example, we are using a task template, check the docs to [create a fully custom dataset](https://docs.argilla.io/en/latest/practical_guides/create_update_dataset/create_dataset.html).

```python
dataset = rg.FeedbackDataset.for_text_classification(
    labels=['sadness', 'joy'],
    multi_label=False,
    use_markdown=True,
    guidelines=None,
    metadata_properties=None,
    vectors_settings=None,
)
dataset.push_to_argilla(name="my-first-dataset", workspace="<your-workspace>")
```

**5.Add records**

Create a list with the records you want to add. Ensure that you match the fields with the ones specified in the previous step.

You can also use `pandas` or `load_dataset` to [read an existing dataset and create records from it](https://docs.argilla.io/en/latest/practical_guides/create_update_dataset/records.html#add-records).

```python
records = [
    rg.FeedbackRecord(
        fields={
            "text": "I am so happy today",
        },
    ),
    rg.FeedbackRecord(
        fields={
            "text": "I feel sad today",
        },
    )
]
dataset.add_records(records)
```
