Welcome to Argilla! 👋😁 We're thrilled to have you on board. Starting with Argilla is as simple as it gets, and you've successfully taken the first step! Let's set things in motion. 🚀

Argilla is a data curation platform and supports different types of datasets: the `FeedbackDataset`, which stands out for its versatility across various NLP tasks, and other datasets like the `DatasetForTextClassification`, the `DatasetForTokenClassification` and the `DatasetForText2Text`, which are more feature-rich datasets, but specialized only for these tasks. So, you should [select the one that best fits your needs](https://docs.argilla.io/en/latest/practical_guides/choose_dataset.html). Note that the `FeedbackDataset` will replace the other datasets in version 2.0.

Once you've selected a dataset, you can open one of our introductory tutorials to create a [FeedbackDataset](https://colab.research.google.com/github/argilla-io/argilla/blob/develop/docs/_source/getting_started/quickstart_workflow_feedback.ipynb) or [Other datasets](https://colab.research.google.com/github/argilla-io/argilla/blob/develop/docs/_source/getting_started/quickstart_workflow.ipynb). First, you'll need to connect to Argilla as instructed and then just follow the guided process. You'll be able to create a dataset in a few minutes. 🤩
