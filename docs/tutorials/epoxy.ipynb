    "\n",
    "## What is weak supervision? and FlyingSquid? and Epoxy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Weak supervision is a branch of machine learning based on getting lower quality labels more efficiently. We can achieve this by using FlyingSquid, a new framework for automatically building label models from multiple user-defined labelling functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Epoxy is a library to turn the labelling functions produced by FlyingSquid into *extended labelling functions* through nearest-neighbors search with pre-trained word embeddings. This allows us to expand the coverage of our heuristic rules beyond the records that we have directly annotated with them.\n",
