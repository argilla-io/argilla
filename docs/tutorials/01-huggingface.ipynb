    "### Natural language inference with the `MRPC` dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Inference (NLI) is also a very common NLP task, but a little different to regular Text Classification. In NLI, the model receives a premise and a hypothesis, and it must figure out if the premise hypothesis is true or not given the premise. We have three categories: entailment (true), contradiction (false) or neutral (undetermined or unrelated). With the premise *\"We live in a flat planet called Earth\"*, the hypothesis *\"The Earth is flat\"* must be classified as entailment, as it is stated in the premise. NLI works with a sort of close-world assumption, in that everything not defined in the premise cannot be inferred from the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key difference from Text Classification is that the input come in pairs of two sentences or texts, not only one. Text Classification treats its input as a cohesive and correlated unit, while NLI treats its input as a pair and tries to find correlation. \n",
    "\n",
    "To play around with NLI we are going to use 🤗 Hub [GLUE benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue) over the MRPC task. GLUE is a well-known benchmark resource for NLP, and allow us to use its data directly over the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus, a corpus of online news.\n"
