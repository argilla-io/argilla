    "- 🔧 The test set is used for evaluating our weak labels, label model and downstream news classifier.\n",
    "- 🤯 We achieve 0.84 macro avg. f1-score without using a single example from the original dataset and using a pretty lightweight model (scikit-learn's `MultinomialNB`).\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Weak supervision is a branch of machine learning where noisy, limited, or imprecise sources are used to provide supervision signal for labeling large amounts of training data in a supervised learning setting. This approach alleviates the burden of obtaining hand-labeled data sets, which can be costly or impractical. Instead, inexpensive weak labels are employed with the understanding that they are imperfect, but can nonetheless be used to create a strong predictive model.* [[Wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_supervision)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a broader introduction to weak supervision, as well as further references, we recommend the excellent [overview by Alex Ratner et al.](https://www.snorkel.org/blog/weak-supervision).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to be a practical introduction to weak supervision and will walk you through its entire process.\n",
    "First we will generate weak labels with *Rubrix*, combine these labels with *Snorkel*, and finally train a classifier with *Scikit Learn*."
