    "In this tutorial, we'll build a sentiment classifier for user requests in the banking domain as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🏁 Start with the most popular sentiment classifier on the Hugging Face Hub (2.3 million monthly downloads as of July 2021) which has been fine-tuned on the SST2 sentiment dataset. \n",

    "- 🏷️ Label a training dataset with banking user requests starting with the pre-trained sentiment classifier predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ⚙️ Fine-tune the pre-trained classifier with your training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🏷️ Label more data by correcting the predictions of the fine-tuned model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ⚙️ Fine-tune the pre-trained classifier with the extended training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show you how to fine-tune a sentiment classifier for your own domain, starting with no labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most online tutorials about fine-tuning models assume you already have a training dataset. You'll find many tutorials for fine-tuning a pre-trained model with widely-used datasets, such as IMDB for sentiment analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, very often **what you want is to fine-tune a model for your use case**. It's well-known that NLP model performance degrades with \"out-of-domain\" data. For example, a sentiment classifier pre-trained on movie reviews (e.g., IMDB) will not perform very well with customer requests.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is one of the most subjective tasks in NLP. What we understand by sentiment will vary from one application to another and depend on the business objectives of the project. Also, sentiment can be modeled in different ways, leading to different **labeling schemes**. For example, sentiment can be modeled as real value (going from -1 to 1, from 0 to 1.0, etc.) or with 2 or more labels (including different degrees such as positive, negative, neutral, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we'll use the **original labeling scheme** defined by the pre-trained model which is composed of two labels: `POSITIVE` and `NEGATIVE`. We could have added the `NEUTRAL` label, but let's keep it simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important issue when approaching a data annotaion project are the **annotation guidelines**, which explain how to assign the labels to specific examples. As we'll see later, the messages we'll be labeling are mostly questions with a neutral sentiment, which we'll label with the `POSITIVE` label, and some other are negative questions which we'll label with the `NEGATIVE` label. Later on, we'll show some examples of each label.\n",
