# Switch workspaces

This feature turns out very convenient when users need to use different workspaces for different purposes.

The **switch workspace** menu is located in the upper right-hand corner, where the user icon is shown. It displays a **log out** and a **view docs** button.

The **log out** button allows users to log out or to change the workspace. After clicking on the user icon and choosing this option, users will see the main page, where they can log in again.

The **view docs** button is used to access the **reference documentation**.
