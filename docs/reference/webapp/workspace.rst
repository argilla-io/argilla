Workspace
==========
This is the **entry point** to Rubrix. From this page, it is possible to open one or multiple datasets in order to work with them. 

Rubrix's Workspace is a **searchable and sortable list** of **datasets**, which contains the following attributes:

- **Search datasets bar**: this search bar allows users to search any keyword for finding a specific dataset, in case the list of datasets gets too long.
- **Name**
- **Tags**
- **Task**
- **Created at**
- **Updated at**
- **Refresh button** (in the sidebar)
