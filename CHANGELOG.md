## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add the fields to retrieve when loading the data from argilla. `rg.load` takes too long because of the vector field, even when users don't need it. Closes [#2398](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla/issues/2398)
- Add new page and components for dataset settings. Closes [#2442](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla/issues/2003)
- Add ability to show image in records (for TokenClassification and TextClassification) if an URL is passed in metadata with the key \_image_url
- Non-searchable fields support in metadata. (#2570)

### Changed

- Labels are now centralized in a specific vuex ORM called GlobalLabel Model, see https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla/issues/2210. This model is the same for TokenClassification and TextClassification (so both task have labels with color_id and shortcuts parameters in the vuex ORM)
- The shortcuts improvement for labels [#2339](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla/pull/2339) have been moved to the vuex ORM in dataset settings feature [#2444](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla/commit/eb37c3bcff3ad253481d6a10f8abb093384f2dcb)
- Update "Define a labeling schema" section in docs.

### Fixes

- Allow URL to be clickable in Jupyter notebook again. Closes [#2527](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla/issues/2527)

### Removed

- Removing some data scan deprecated endpoints used by old clients. This change will break compatibility with client `<v1.3.0`
- Stop using old scan deprecated endpoints in python client. This logic will break client compatibility with server version `<1.3.0`
- Remove the previous way to add labels through the dataset page. Now labels can be added only through dataset settings page.
