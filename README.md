![Rubrix Intro](https://github.com/dvsrepo/imgs/blob/main/0shot_explore.gif)

[Rubrix](https://rubrix.ml) is a free and open-source tool for exploring and iterating on data for artificial intelligence projects. 

Rubrix focuses on enabling novel, human in the loop workflows involving data scientists, subject matter experts and ML/data engineers. 

![](docs/images/rubrix_intro.svg)

With Rubrix, you can:

- **Monitor** the predictions of deployed models.
- **Label** data with a novel search-guided, iterative workflow.
- **Iterate** on ****ground-truth**** and predictions to debug, track and improve your data and models over time.
- **Build** custom ****dashboards**** on top of your model predictions and labels.

Rubrix is composed of:

- a **Python library** to bridge data and models, which you can install via `pip`.
- a **web application** to explore and label data, which you can launch using Docker or directly with Python.


This is an example of Rubrix's labeling mode:

![Rubrix Annotation Mode](https://github.com/dvsrepo/imgs/blob/main/rubrix_annotation_mode.gif)

And this is an example for logging model predictions from a ü§ó transformers text classification pipeline:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
from datasets import load_dataset
import rubrix as rb

model = pipeline('zero-shot-classification', model="typeform/squeezebert-mnli")

dataset = load_dataset("ag_news", split='test[0:100]')

# Our labels are: ['World', 'Sports', 'Business', 'Sci/Tech']
labels = dataset.features["label"].names

for record in dataset:
    prediction = model(record['text'], labels)

    item = rb.TextClassificationRecord(
        inputs=record["text"],
        prediction=list(zip(prediction['labels'], prediction['scores'])),
        annotation=labels[record["label"]]
    )

    rb.log(item, name="ag_news_zeroshot")
```

# Get started

To get started you need to follow three steps:

1. Install the Python client
2. Launch the web app
3. Start logging data
   
## 1. Install the Python client

You can install the Python client with `pip`:

```bash
pip install rubrix
```

## 2. Launch the web app

There are two ways to launch the webapp:

- a) Using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (**recommended**).
- b) Executing the server code manually

### a) Using docker-compose (recommended)

Create a folder:

```bash
mkdir rubrix && cd rubrix
```

and launch the docker-contained web app with the following command:

```bash
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://git.io/rb-docker && docker-compose up
```

This is the recommended way because it automatically includes an
[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) instance, Rubrix's main persistence layer.

### b) Executing the server code manually

When executing the server code manually you need to provide an [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) instance yourself.

1. First you need to install
   [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/install-elasticsearch.html)
   (we recommend version 7.10) and launch an Elasticsearch instance.
   For MacOS and Windows there are
   [Homebrew formulae](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/brew.html) and a
   [msi package](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/windows.html), respectively.
2. Install the Rubrix Python library together with its server dependencies:

```bash
pip install rubrix[server]
```

3. Launch a local instance of the Rubrix web app

```bash
python -m rubrix.server
```

By default, the Rubrix server will look for your Elasticsearch endpoint at ``http://localhost:9200``.
But you can customize this by setting the ``ELASTICSEARCH`` environment variable.

## 3. Start logging data

The following code will log one record into a data set called `example-dataset`:

```python
import rubrix as rb

rb.log(
    rb.TextClassificationRecord(inputs="My first Rubrix example"),
    name='example-dataset'
)
```

If you go to your Rubrix app at http://localhost:6900/, you should see your first dataset.
**The default username and password are ``rubrix`` and ``1234``**.
You can also check the REST API docs at http://localhost:6900/api/docs.

Congratulations! You are ready to start working with Rubrix.

To better understand what's possible take a look at Rubrix's [Cookbook](https://docs.rubrix.ml/en/stable/guides/cookbook.html)
