        __client: the `httpx.Client` initialized to interact with the Argilla API.

        username: the username of the user.
        first_name: the first name of the user.
        last_name: the last name of the user. Defaults to None.
        full_name: the full name of the user. Defaults to None.

        inserted_at: the datetime when the user was created.
