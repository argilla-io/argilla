      Since <code>1.2.0</code> Argilla supports adding vectors to Argilla
      records which can then be used for finding the most similar records to a
      given one.

    <p>
      This feature uses vector or semantic search combined with more traditional
      search (keyword and filter based). Vector search leverages machine
      learning to capture rich semantic features by embedding items (text,
      video, images, etc.) into a vector space, which can be then used to find
      "semantically" similar items.
    </p>
    <p>
      To benefit from this feature, your data team must include vectors
      associated with each record when they create the dataset. More in
